14,So i need some help..," Recently i've been wondering something. I've had this adidas zip up jacket in my closet for over 2 years now, and ive never known whether it was real or not, rare or not, or even where i bought it, even if i bought it. My parents or my brother probably did, but neither of them can tell me where exactly. I love this zip up jacket, it looks good. But can someone just give me a tiny bit of information on this? Thanks. (Also huge apologies for the shitty quality in the pictures.)

68,Adidas Canada Warranty Nightmare,"I've placed several orders with [adidas.ca](https://adidas.ca) over the past couple of years and was very satisfied.  But my latest experience was horrible!

I ordered a pair of Copa Mundial Cleats for my daughter.  Within a month of use, the toe separated.  I contacted warranty and got an RA#, sent the shoes back and received confirmation from UPS that they had been received on July 30.  After waiting a few weeks, I contacted Adidas at least five times.  I had been told the issue would be prioritized, another told me it would be escalated, another told me she would personally make the warranty department aware of the issue, since it had been about 6 weeks by then that the shoes had been received by adidas.

On September 19 I was told I'd be issued a voucher as a refund.  As of today, October 1, I still had not received ANY emails from adidas about my claim, nor received a voucher.  So I called today and spent about an hour on the phone talking with one person who finally issued me a voucher.  BUT, he also said that it was only good for the purchase of a single item!  This claim had gone on so long that I had to purchase another pair of Mundials for my daughter, since she was going overseas for soccer.  I was planning to use the voucher to purchase a pair of Mundial Team Shoes for myself.and a couple of other items to make up the $200.

The voucher would not even work for the Mundial Team Shoes, as they are excluded from the promo code (voucher).  So I had to call customer service yet again.  After about 20 minutes she was able to allow me to use the voucher for the shoes.  But she also told me that my purchase had to be $200 or more, so I had to add other items to my order.  So I added two more items to make the order over $200.  Well the voucher went through, but it was indeed only for a single item.  It asked me for another $52.50 for the other items.  So I lost $50 ($40 difference in value of the voucher, plus the GST of $10 because the representative who issued the voucher could not issue the voucher for $210, only the purchase price).  I didn't really need the other two items, but I had no way of deleting the extra two items while in the checkout without risking having to start all over again and then probably finding out that my voucher had already been used.

I am 63 years old and in all my life I have never had such a terrible experience with customer service and wasted so much of my time because of a warranty issue!!!",adidas,1569951469,YUKONER777,1,2,True,2019-10-01

She wore a longline satin blazer as a dress, then added some square-toe boots and a [mesh camera bag](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525086&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donnakaran.com%2Fproduct%2Febony%2Bmesh%2Bcamera%2Bbag.do%3Fsortby%3DourPicksAscend%26page%3D2%26from%3Dfn%26selectedOption%3D566108&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seventeen.com%2Ffashion%2Fceleb-fashion%2Fg598%2Fkendall-and-kylie-best-street-style%2F) – that, FYI, is [currently on sale for $79](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525086&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donnakaran.com%2Fproduct%2Febony%2Bmesh%2Bcamera%2Bbag.do%3Fsortby%3DourPicksAscend%26page%3D2%26from%3Dfn%26selectedOption%3D566108&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seventeen.com%2Ffashion%2Fceleb-fashion%2Fg598%2Fkendall-and-kylie-best-street-style%2F). This is officially the most supermodel look I've ever seen.

In honor of National Sibling Day, Kim Kardashian shared a photo op of her and Kylie Jenner wearing matching outfits, the likes of which I have never seen before in my life. They're kind of like one-legged bodysuits that are also boots? Or like, over-the-shoulder boots? I'm not really sure what to call these. Either way, fashion has just reached another new (weird) milestone, courtesy of the Kardashian/Jenner fam.

**Tiger Blazer and a Bra**

Bras and blazers, day two! For the second time this week, King Kylie (does she still call herself that?) forgot to put on a shirt before leaving the house. She showed off a black bra at Khloe Kardashian's birthday party and wow, we have truly been blessed.

**Bra and a Blazer**

Sexy blazer looks are becoming a Kardashian/Jenner staple. Kim loves [going topless under the business casual jackets](https://www.seventeen.com/fashion/celeb-fashion/g1746/kim-kardashian-makeover/) and now Kylie's getting in on the trend. She posted a fire Instagram wearing nothing but a lacy bra under a silky maroon blazer. In related news, my smoke alarm is now going off.

**Girly Sweater and Jeans**The queen of Fashion Nova is back with another fire fit for under $100. Kylie's servin bod in a $30 fluff crop top and ass-hugging $35 jeans – both of which are still available online in almost every size. I never thought I'd have a burning desire to own a one-shoulder sweater, but alas, the power of Kylie.

Found my dream shoes, but Adidas has been continually sold out and I couldn't find them anywhere (not even many hits on Google; maybe they're rare?) save for on Poshmark. After weeks of deliberating, I decided to role the die and go for it. They just came and can't tell if I'm creating a mountain out of a molehill with the issues I'm noticing. Researched ""how to spot fakes"" all day and I'm literally 50/50 at this point. Apologies in advance for being such a noob!

Adidas page to actual shoe (best look): adidas.com/us/stan-smith-shoes/G27997.html

The main issues I've noticed are these below, but I can't tell if these differences are just inherent to a professional photoshoot vs. the real thing:

* More snakeskin-like texture on mine
* Color on mine are a tiny bit more pink-looking
* Certain trim appears to be red on mine compared to white on the website
* Some bad stitching in certain spots and small fraying
* Tried scanning barcode with various apps and returned no matching results (but again, these seem rare anyhow)
   * Note that I already checked the ART number against the box (matches perfectly) and that the shoes have serial #'s that differ in the last 3 digits (they do).

The ones that have 3 stripes on the peak (example: https://i.imgur.com/UOQD5om.png ) don't have any stitching on the peak which leads to the underside of the peak having the material stretched tight but coming away from the hard peak so it has a ""spongy"" feel when you press it. The caps I have with plain peaks have stitching on both sides of the peak and don't suffer from this sponginess at all.

So my question is: do Adidas make a baseball cap that has stripes on the peak that is also stitched to avoid this sponginess issue or does the addition of the stripes on the peak mean they can't do the stitching?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone, we are on the verge of launching the future of legit checks, offering quality and consistent checks faster than you can imagine. Feel free to message me to check out our website to see how we will operate! If you don't want to legit check you can still enter your email to get an exclusive launch offer! We've made some edits to address the questions from last time.

[www.itslegitshoes.com](https://www.itslegitshoes.com)

&amp;#x200B;

*  We want to be 100% transparent with you all, this isn't a get rich quick scheme, but we need to fix the current status of legit checks
*  A free check on Reddit or Facebook can take hours to days sometimes going unanswered, and when you check the comments, it's flooded with random users you can't trust arguing over fake and real comments, this achieves nothing and makes the prospective buyer more anxious about the purchase.
* We are here to offer consistent and quality checks, with a definitive answer. You'll get the opinions of 3 LCers working together to help you.
* When checks are free, there is no drive to keep quality or speed up. There needs to be an incentive for legit checkers to stay motivated to want to do checks.
*  Each check costs 5$, we have 3 of our trained legit checkers discuss and pick each others brains before collectively deciding on the outcome
*  Each legit checker is paid 1$ per check, the remaining 2$ are split between maintaining the store, building the community, and creating more resources to keep our legit checkers up to par for every new shoe, and the staff who works on other aspects of the community. 
*  We offer an extremely simple to use user interface, operating on Discord allows much greater ease of use while on any device.
*  We still have a few positions open in the community and are looking to recruit some eager staff to launch this project with. 
*  The legit checker position will be monetized, so it will be a way to make money and help the community for you.  

 If you're interested in helping the community avoid getting scammed with fakes and think you have the skills to be part of the team, leave a comment here or send me a message!",adidas,1565899409,MertyTC,3,0,True,2019-08-15
63,Anyone have experience with Adidas.com cancelling an order without notice?,"long story short -- bought the yeezy waverunners on monday and payment went through, order confirmed...thought I finally caught the W. Fast-forward to today, and no progress has happened in the shipping, so i called customer service. They tell me they're sold out/back-ordered, and that it's a ""99% chance your order will be cancelled.""

Order is still confirmed on their website/app, my credit card was charged, and there's a limited retail release this Saturday, so Adidas clearly has some extra stock lying around. Really annoyed that Adidas didn't even send me an email updating me on the process, have yet to refund me, and had I not reached out I would just be sitting here twiddling my thumbs.

73,My feet don’t think boost is comfy.,I’ve recently bought a pair of ultraboost 4.0s and right when I bought them I noticed the boost felt hard and uncomfy. The feeling got better and the boost doesn’t feel so uncomfortable anymore but it still feels somewhat hard. I went to an adidas store in nyc to test the nite joggers and when I walked with them they also didn’t feel squishy or responsive at all. I didn’t get a pair of nite joggers since they didn’t have them in my size. If it changes anything I’m about 100-110 pounds and I’m just a teen.

Contacted a rep over the chat and basically told to cancelled and reorder again, which I was heistant. I am afraid doing so be another long wait and I wouldnt be getting the discounted price I gotten it.

However, the package says that it was signed and delivered to my address in my name, which was impossible because I wasn't in the state at the time. I contacted adidas and they told me to open a case with FedEx and present them proof that I did not receive the package. I attached flight records, AirBnb records, receipts of purchases I made with my debit card, etc., enough to show that I was not home at the delivery of the package. FedEx denied my claim twice and told me that there is nothing they could do about the package, because they delivered it to the right address. I contacted adidas multiple times after that, and eventually they told me that there was nothing they can do because FedEx denied the claim. I purchased the items on Paypal, so it is impossible to do a chargeback because they don't cover stolen/missing packages. Are there any other steps I can do?

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell is going on with my order?  I placed an order on 6/25 and it is still processing and your phone support told me that you will probably end up cancelling it.  I am a ""game changer"" which means I have spent a good bit of money with you and apparently that is supposed to have 2nd day shipping.  Why hasn't it been shipped?  Where is my refund?  Aren't I considered to be a valued customer?

I bought Ultraboosts as a gift for my mom since she is elderly and has to stand all day.  She is in a lot of pain and I bought these because they are great shoes and I hoped it would help her.  Unfortunately, she never got them because your shipping is garbage.  These were an expensive gift and all of that money spent is just wasted for the time being.

I am out of options because no one at Adidas wants to help.  I have posted multiple times to your Instagram account about this in hopes that someone would contact me.  Instead I have been blocked and my messages removed.  Adidas has not contacted me yet.

Once I finally got through to someone after they started an ""investigation"" into where they could be, one of their employees confirmed they were shipped to a different warehouse.  
Now it's July and I have been on the phone with them numerous times trying to get a refund.  I was even issued an email stating it would be deposited within 3-5 business days (obviously this didn't happen).  
I called AGAIN and they told me the payment was being froze but couldn't answer ANYTHING further then this, and there was noone I could talk to about getting my refund.  It was being handled ""overseas"" so there is no number to call or contact.  


So since that drop in March, it has been **MY** responsibility to find the solution to this problem (I guess by nagging them?) or they would have swept it under the rug and I would be out $300 CAD.

62,Does Boost have any negative effect on the body?,"I've been wearing Boost for sometime, before it was Puma's NRGZ, since both are pretty much similar tech, i had to roll back to non-boost shoe as the Boost is waiting to be dried. I noticed that on the non-boost shoe my feet feels fatigue after a while, and after a whole day of walk awaken in the middle of the night i felt some mild back pain.

Before wearing NRGZ/Boost, i've always have tired feet but it never felt that tired, just tired, and i never had back pain, while everything felt better with Boost, i'm wondering if the softer cushion actually weakens some parts of the body so when you revert back to non-boost shoes your body cannot take it as much as before?

I'm sure you can say it's like comparing a cheap chair with a good chair, you won't go back to the cheap chair and the moment you do you felt the big difference, going back to non-boost i can clearly tell the difference but i can also remember i did not felt that bad last time. it's only less than 2 years since i wore foam type shoes. Even on flip flops for a short walk i can feel my feet are tired.

I'm just worried with the Boost, it somehow makes certain part of the body weak, similar to wearing ankle braces, while it helps reduce injury it also weakens the ankles if wore on daily basis.",adidas,1560486034,burningbun,11,2,True,2019-06-14

However, I always find myself really liking the men’s models more so I have learned to size down to boys youth size 6 1/2 to 7. I have a recent pair of Tubular Shadows in a 7 and I regret not getting a 6 or 6.5 tbh. When I first bought them and tried them on, they fit pretty well but after some wear it seems like the knit just really loosened up.

Right now I have two pairs of Sobakovs in a 7 and a 6 1/2. The 6 1/2 fit nice and snug with thin invisible socks. The seven could definitely be worn with some thicker socks and otherwise feel pretty good. 

If I keep the 6 1/2 I’m scared that my toes may deform the shoe if I end up putting extra pressure on the balls of my feet, but they are in no way “small“. On the other hand, I’m scared that if I keep the size 7, they will end up like my Tubulars that just feel hella loose after some wear.


For anyone who has these shoes, have you noticed any extra stretching? I googled a bunch but there aren’t very many concrete answers except for the fact that the sizing of this model is a little bit confusing and many people have had to even size down one entire size.

I’m trying to not overthink this too much but because of my previous experience, I really don’t want to make the wrong choice since the triple blacks were harder to track down than I expected.

Both were recommended for people with wide feet and praised for their stability and comfort. My only gripe with the ST is the heel tab. It feels off and just unnecessary.

I'm looking for a kind of Samba/Kaiser 5 hybrid, I bought these shoes around 2007/8 in Germany.

The stripes go all the way to the base of the sole (the sole looks exactly like the one of the sambas, only the logo might be different), but other parts like the upper part of the heel, the stitching pattern in the front and the tounge (without the Kaiser 5 stitch of course) are almost exactly like the Kaiser 5 ones. It doesn't have any kind of golden letters near the stripes or suede at the tip like the Sambas.

I threw them away cause they were pretty broken after 12 years of sports and wearing them eyery day and bought Sambas because I couldn't find them anwhere (I wouldn't wonder if they actually don't have a name). Sambas are great, but I don't like them as much as my old ones.

They are just normal alphabounces, I don't know if they have a name variant like EM or beyond? but bottom line is I'm looking to replace them. They have been my everyday shoe since I bought them. I have recently purchased replacement alpha bounces but the sole is nowhere near as comfortable as my old ones. It looks like the sole on the new ones are reinforced to protect the shoe better, which is understandable as that's the reason i need new ones. But the comfort level of my old ones are just unmatched by what I've found in the store. 

Sorry if this question has been posed before but I'm looking for help with identifying the ones I originally bought with the end goal being purchasing the same exact shoes.
