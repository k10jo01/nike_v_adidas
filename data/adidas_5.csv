167,Are there any baseball caps with 3 stripes on peak that are stitched on the back?,"Let me explain. I have a small but growing collection of adidas baseball caps. The ones that have 3 stripes on the peak (example: https://i.imgur.com/UOQD5om.png ) don't have any stitching on the peak which leads to the underside of the peak having the material stretched tight but coming away from the hard peak so it has a ""spongy"" feel when you press it. The caps I have with plain peaks have stitching on both sides of the peak and don't suffer from this sponginess at all.

So my question is: do Adidas make a baseball cap that has stripes on the peak that is also stitched to avoid this sponginess issue or does the addition of the stripes on the peak mean they can't do the stitching?

323,Adidas Canada Warranty Nightmare,"I've placed several orders with [adidas.ca](https://adidas.ca) over the past couple of years and was very satisfied.  But my latest experience was horrible!

I ordered a pair of Copa Mundial Cleats for my daughter.  Within a month of use, the toe separated.  I contacted warranty and got an RA#, sent the shoes back and received confirmation from UPS that they had been received on July 30.  After waiting a few weeks, I contacted Adidas at least five times.  I had been told the issue would be prioritized, another told me it would be escalated, another told me she would personally make the warranty department aware of the issue, since it had been about 6 weeks by then that the shoes had been received by adidas.

On September 19 I was told I'd be issued a voucher as a refund.  As of today, October 1, I still had not received ANY emails from adidas about my claim, nor received a voucher.  So I called today and spent about an hour on the phone talking with one person who finally issued me a voucher.  BUT, he also said that it was only good for the purchase of a single item!  This claim had gone on so long that I had to purchase another pair of Mundials for my daughter, since she was going overseas for soccer.  I was planning to use the voucher to purchase a pair of Mundial Team Shoes for myself.and a couple of other items to make up the $200.

The voucher would not even work for the Mundial Team Shoes, as they are excluded from the promo code (voucher).  So I had to call customer service yet again.  After about 20 minutes she was able to allow me to use the voucher for the shoes.  But she also told me that my purchase had to be $200 or more, so I had to add other items to my order.  So I added two more items to make the order over $200.  Well the voucher went through, but it was indeed only for a single item.  It asked me for another $52.50 for the other items.  So I lost $50 ($40 difference in value of the voucher, plus the GST of $10 because the representative who issued the voucher could not issue the voucher for $210, only the purchase price).  I didn't really need the other two items, but I had no way of deleting the extra two items while in the checkout without risking having to start all over again and then probably finding out that my voucher had already been used.

I am 63 years old and in all my life I have never had such a terrible experience with customer service and wasted so much of my time because of a warranty issue!!!",adidas,1569951469,YUKONER777,1,2,True,2019-10-01

She wore a longline satin blazer as a dress, then added some square-toe boots and a [mesh camera bag](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525086&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donnakaran.com%2Fproduct%2Febony%2Bmesh%2Bcamera%2Bbag.do%3Fsortby%3DourPicksAscend%26page%3D2%26from%3Dfn%26selectedOption%3D566108&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seventeen.com%2Ffashion%2Fceleb-fashion%2Fg598%2Fkendall-and-kylie-best-street-style%2F) ‚Äì that, FYI, is [currently on sale for $79](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525086&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donnakaran.com%2Fproduct%2Febony%2Bmesh%2Bcamera%2Bbag.do%3Fsortby%3DourPicksAscend%26page%3D2%26from%3Dfn%26selectedOption%3D566108&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seventeen.com%2Ffashion%2Fceleb-fashion%2Fg598%2Fkendall-and-kylie-best-street-style%2F). This is officially the most supermodel look I've ever seen.

In honor of National Sibling Day, Kim Kardashian shared a photo op of her and Kylie Jenner wearing matching outfits, the likes of which I have never seen before in my life. They're kind of like one-legged bodysuits that are also boots? Or like, over-the-shoulder boots? I'm not really sure what to call these. Either way, fashion has just reached another new (weird) milestone, courtesy of the Kardashian/Jenner fam.

**Tiger Blazer and a Bra**

Bras and blazers, day two! For the second time this week, King Kylie (does she still call herself that?) forgot to put on a shirt before leaving the house. She showed off a black bra at Khloe Kardashian's birthday party and wow, we have truly been blessed.

**Bra and a Blazer**

Sexy blazer looks are becoming a Kardashian/Jenner staple. Kim loves [going topless under the business casual jackets](https://www.seventeen.com/fashion/celeb-fashion/g1746/kim-kardashian-makeover/) and now Kylie's getting in on the trend. She posted a fire Instagram wearing nothing but a lacy bra under a silky maroon blazer. In related news, my smoke alarm is now going off.

**Girly Sweater and Jeans**The queen of Fashion Nova is back with another fire fit for under $100. Kylie's servin bod in a $30 fluff crop top and ass-hugging $35 jeans ‚Äì both of which are still available online in almost every size. I never thought I'd have a burning desire to own a one-shoulder sweater, but alas, the power of Kylie.

Found my dream shoes, but Adidas has been continually sold out and I couldn't find them anywhere (not even many hits on Google; maybe they're rare?) save for on Poshmark. After weeks of deliberating, I decided to role the die and go for it. They just came and can't tell if I'm creating a mountain out of a molehill with the issues I'm noticing. Researched ""how to spot fakes"" all day and I'm literally 50/50 at this point. Apologies in advance for being such a noob!

Adidas page to actual shoe (best look): adidas.com/us/stan-smith-shoes/G27997.html

The main issues I've noticed are these below, but I can't tell if these differences are just inherent to a professional photoshoot vs. the real thing:

* More snakeskin-like texture on mine
* Color on mine are a tiny bit more pink-looking
* Certain trim appears to be red on mine compared to white on the website
* Some bad stitching in certain spots and small fraying
* Tried scanning barcode with various apps and returned no matching results (but again, these seem rare anyhow)
   * Note that I already checked the ART number against the box (matches perfectly) and that the shoes have serial #'s that differ in the last 3 digits (they do).

I‚Äôm in the market for new shoes, and I‚Äôve never had boosts before. After some recommendations, I‚Äôve decided to get UBs for casual wear.

But on the Adidas site, I see PUREBOOSTs, PUREBOOST Go, and PUREBOOST DPR. Can anyone give me a good recommendation for the best PB shoe between the Go, the DPR, and the regular Pureboost?

...but the soles feel *nothing* alike. The other pairs started super soft, and got harder as time went on, but were still fairly soft. These Asweegos feel like BRICKS in comparison, even brand new. I like the style and look, but damn, its disappointing that these dont feel soft at all.",adidas,1565629663,kdjfsk,1,2,True,2019-08-12

I contacted adidas and they told me to open a case with FedEx and present them proof that I did not receive the package. I attached flight records, AirBnb records, receipts of purchases I made with my debit card, etc., enough to show that I was not home at the delivery of the package. FedEx denied my claim twice and told me that there is nothing they could do about the package, because they delivered it to the right address. I contacted adidas multiple times after that, and eventually they told me that there was nothing they can do because FedEx denied the claim. I purchased the items on Paypal, so it is impossible to do a chargeback because they don't cover stolen/missing packages. Are there any other steps I can do?

Once I finally got through to someone after they started an ""investigation"" into where they could be, one of their employees confirmed they were shipped to a different warehouse.  
Now it's July and I have been on the phone with them numerous times trying to get a refund.  I was even issued an email stating it would be deposited within 3-5 business days (obviously this didn't happen).  
I called AGAIN and they told me the payment was being froze but couldn't answer ANYTHING further then this, and there was noone I could talk to about getting my refund.  It was being handled ""overseas"" so there is no number to call or contact.  


So since that drop in March, it has been **MY** responsibility to find the solution to this problem (I guess by nagging them?) or they would have swept it under the rug and I would be out $300 CAD.

312,Does Boost have any negative effect on the body?,"I've been wearing Boost for sometime, before it was Puma's NRGZ, since both are pretty much similar tech, i had to roll back to non-boost shoe as the Boost is waiting to be dried. I noticed that on the non-boost shoe my feet feels fatigue after a while, and after a whole day of walk awaken in the middle of the night i felt some mild back pain.

Before wearing NRGZ/Boost, i've always have tired feet but it never felt that tired, just tired, and i never had back pain, while everything felt better with Boost, i'm wondering if the softer cushion actually weakens some parts of the body so when you revert back to non-boost shoes your body cannot take it as much as before?

I'm sure you can say it's like comparing a cheap chair with a good chair, you won't go back to the cheap chair and the moment you do you felt the big difference, going back to non-boost i can clearly tell the difference but i can also remember i did not felt that bad last time. it's only less than 2 years since i wore foam type shoes. Even on flip flops for a short walk i can feel my feet are tired.

I'm just worried with the Boost, it somehow makes certain part of the body weak, similar to wearing ankle braces, while it helps reduce injury it also weakens the ankles if wore on daily basis.",adidas,1560486034,burningbun,11,2,True,2019-06-14

However, I always find myself really liking the men‚Äôs models more so I have learned to size down to boys youth size 6 1/2 to 7. I have a recent pair of Tubular Shadows in a 7 and I regret not getting a 6 or 6.5 tbh. When I first bought them and tried them on, they fit pretty well but after some wear it seems like the knit just really loosened up.

Right now I have two pairs of Sobakovs in a 7 and a 6 1/2. The 6 1/2 fit nice and snug with thin invisible socks. The seven could definitely be worn with some thicker socks and otherwise feel pretty good. 

If I keep the 6 1/2 I‚Äôm scared that my toes may deform the shoe if I end up putting extra pressure on the balls of my feet, but they are in no way ‚Äúsmall‚Äú. On the other hand, I‚Äôm scared that if I keep the size 7, they will end up like my Tubulars that just feel hella loose after some wear.


For anyone who has these shoes, have you noticed any extra stretching? I googled a bunch but there aren‚Äôt very many concrete answers except for the fact that the sizing of this model is a little bit confusing and many people have had to even size down one entire size.

185,Shoe Identification,"Alright lads, I'm going mad trying to  identify a 2 y/o pair of NMDs (?) I own. I'm 98% sure they are legit, as  I got them in JD Sports (UK).

They look like a perfect hybrid between the NMD\_R1 PKs (pictured left) and the NMD CS 2s (pictured right).

They  are laced, like the R1, but don't have any rigid eyelets, instead the  laces weave through holes punched directly through the mesh. They have  black &amp; white snakeskin patterned mesh and the orange vertical  stripes in the same place as both below. They do NOT have the ankle  elastic running to the midsoles like the CS2, simply connecting around  the top like the R1. All other differences are shown below.

I would attach an image of my own pair, but they are filthy and have been well loved, but not cared for properly.

Any help would be appreciated, as I've been looking and looking with no luck.

It doesn't have any kind of golden letters near the stripes or suede at the tip like the Sambas.

I threw them away cause they were pretty broken after 12 years of sports and wearing them eyery day and bought Sambas because I couldn't find them anwhere (I wouldn't wonder if they actually don't have a name). Sambas are great, but I don't like them as much as my old ones.

I have a favorite pair of black and white Adidas track pants.  They are flared and there is no ankle zipper.

'For loose fit, go one size up.'

Good news for all the ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô. No, it‚Äôs not about winters coming or going but Adidas launching a new sneaker collection based on the hit HBO series. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wdluhkpthlo21.jpg

Based on the fantasy novel of George RR Martin, ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô has received an overwhelming response from audiences from all the world. Adidas, after months of speculation, has officially brought a new range of sneakers for the series fans. 

The collection consists of six Ultra Boost 4.0 trainers, each design mirrors well-known elements from the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms (and the freaky White Walkers that live beyond the Wall). That means striking red with gold stripes for the Lannisters, dark grey for House Stark, icy blue for white walkers, a blend of fiery orange and black for House of Targaryen and all-black with white mudguard for Night‚Äôs Watch. Also, on the heels of the shoes are tags featuring well-known phrases from the series including ‚ÄúWinter is Coming‚Äù, ‚ÄúWinter is Here‚Äù and ‚ÄúFire and Blood‚Äù. House crests are hidden away at the throat of the sneakers. So, it‚Äôs time to decide where your loyalties lie. 

[Adidas's new sneaker collection](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtnjVMEFCa4/?utm_source=ig_embed)

According to Adidas all the shoes are unisex and feature Adidas‚Äô signature boost midsoles, a Primeknit upper for lightweight performance, and the iconic heel counter for adaptability and support. It is definitely the most comfortable way to get to support your favourite house.

Adidas which is known for its comfort and street style designs, and it‚Äôs for the first time the brand has taken out a collection blending with the popular culture. The collection comes ahead of the final season of the series.

The sneakers are available on www.adidas.ae and retail for Dh750. You guys need to hurry because they‚Äôre selling like hot cakes, thanks to the limited edition and staggering popularity of the show. Some of the sneakers have already sold out, like the icy blue White Walker sneakers and charcoal grey House Stark. Only the white House of Targaryen and red House of Lannister versions are currently available on the UAE site and on Adidas‚Äô US site.",adidas,1553663662,Newzwise,3,1,True,2019-03-27

My toes were pressed up to the top of the shoe and you could always see the indent of the toes. I thought maybe it was because I had to break them in but nope they always felt squished. I'm not sure if wearing these caused me to get ingrown toenails or not but they always felt uncomfortable. I'm a 8.5 and everyone said to go half a size down. Would it be a bad idea to go half a size up? I accidentally bought size 10 workboots for my work and I love how much room there is and they don't slip or anything. ,adidas,1553724936,Rashidoooooo,4,2,True,2019-03-27

297,Ultra Boost and fitting,"So after getting my first pair of Ultra Boost (the Targaryen Dragons that came with a stain! (Which I did get out with some Jason Mark‚Äôs cleaner, did a much better job getting the stain out imho than the Crep) I got the shoes all Crep Protected now and drying... wore them for a while to see how they felt, and they fit great but back heel feels sort of loose! 
I take a size men‚Äôs 14 in ASICS and Nike‚Äôs.  I thought ultraboost were true to size! I tried today a 13 ultraboost and my toe went just a a couple of mm, but they felt slightly crammed in the front of the shoe.. so I think the PERFECT booSt size for me is a half size down, and they don‚Äôt make them in 13.5.
Hoping they break in and my heel gets better grip and fit in the shoe.. feels almost like my heel is to high... 
so I am thinking since Yeezy‚Äôs run slightly smaller and I got thoses in 14, so if my ultraboost size is a 13.5 (I think they don‚Äôt make them though to try) so my Yeezy‚Äôs Geodes and Clays should fit perfect I‚Äôm hoping!

May in a few weeks cop another ultraboost in size 13 and see if they stretch and fit better? 
So anyone that has the half sizes available in the Ultra BooSt 4.0‚Äôs, I would def have gone down a half size from your ASICS/Nike. ",adidas,1553968701,johnsavv,0,2,True,2019-03-30

I didn't receive any email confirmation, and I checked my Adidas US account, and don't see any orders in my order history.

322,Is c21stores.com a scam?,"I recently purchased an adidas duffel bag off of c21stores.

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the photo for the listing on the site.](https://i.redd.it/fr75f25mpbj21.png)

I never blindly order something off a new website, so before I ordered it, I decided to read some reviews for the website. On there website it showed a 4.3 star rating. (Later, after placing my order I discovered that the 4.3 star rating seems faulty due to the fact that on multiple other websites and forums, people give the store a 2.0-3.0 star rating out of 5. ) I ordered this bag due to the fact that its an uncommon adidas bag and it was really inexpensive. $10.99, shipping would've brought it up to $19 but I found a coupon code for free shipping (most small adidas duffel bags sell for $25-$30). I've never been suspicious of my purchase until today. I was trying to log onto my account to confirm that the product will arrive today, but it wouldn't let me. I'm 100% certain that I'm using the correct password due to the fact that I have used this password to log into this account every single day since I ordered the product to track the progress. I soon noticed a label pop up as I was attempting to log in that stated there had been an update to the site that required me to reset my password! I'm like, ""okay, why would I need to reset my password due to an update?"", but I quickly brushed it off. When I attempted to reset my password it asked me to state the email that is associated with my account so that they could send me the reset link, but every time I entered my email, it says, ""please enter a valid email"". Now I probably have to call them to fix my account. You might be wondering how this leads to my question of c21stores being a scam, well your about to see right now. Although I wasn't able to log into my account to check my order progress, I was able to go to my computer history and find the tracking number (shipped with fedex). It's on it's way and says it will arrive later today based on the tracking info. Due to the fact that I wasn't able to see the product I ordered on my account (which they won't let me log into), I decided to use the site as a guest and search for the item I ordered just to freshen my memory, but when I searched it, no results were found. I then typed the name of the bag into google where it showed a listing for it on the very same site, but once I clicked into it, it said page not found or no longer exist. This isn't the only adidas bag that was removed from the site after their mysterious update. Not only that, but most of the bags that had been removed where the ones with the most likes (the ones that bring more earnings) and I don't thinks it's because they're out of stock either. They're completely gone! Do you see where thing get a little more suspicious? If not, don't worry, I'm about to sum it up. Just in case you don't know, if popular brands, such as Adidas, Popsocket, ect, see counterfeits of there products they make the lister remove the product from the site. Now you see where my suspicions come into play. This leads me to believe that the adidas bags they are selling on there site are........ COUNTERFEITS!!! Why else would there Adidas bags mysteriously disappear off of their site. If you don't believe me, here is the link to the bag on the website which will state,"" SORRY, THE PAGE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WAS NOT FOUND OR NO LONGER EXISTS.""[http://www.c21stores.com/products/diablo2smdfpurp6?CAWELAID=500002840002215003](http://www.c21stores.com/products/diablo2smdfpurp6?CAWELAID=500002840002215003)

Also, here are two different photos of the same adidas bag. One that looks more synthetic and one that leans more to the counterfeit side (at least in my opinion).

The 12s were most comfortable but the sneaker guy said they stretch.  But if my foot isnt stretching the fabric will they still stretch?  Does anyone go a full size up in these?  My foot is actually narrow FYI.

Also, I was looking at an ATR from last year cuz I liked the color.  They didn't have my size so I couldn't try them on, so I'm wondering if they are as comfortable as the boost 4s, and also, if the heel counter is as soft, padded and comfortable as the regular ultraboost. I ask cuz I I have heel bursitis and the reg ultraboost heel doesn't hurt at all .  Any thoughts?  Thanks!

Everything went through just fine, after I ordered the website shows that they no longer have size 11 in stock.  Cool, I figured I got the last pair.  Fast forward to January 9th. My order still hasn't shipped from the warehouse.  I contact support to make sure there is no stocking error.  The rep reassures me that everything is fine and my order will ship soon.  An hour after that chat, I get an email stating my order was cancelled (due to stock error). I decided to check the product on the website and right after they cancelled my order, the inventory went from 0 in stock to 3.  I contacted support again to try and figure out what the hell happened.  The person I spoke to said that sometimes their system takes a while to update, and even though it says they have 3 in stock, that it is probably incorrect. They specifically told me not to order again, because it would just be cancelled.  It didn't make sense that the system would update from 0 in stock to 3 in stock right after cancelling my order.

I decided to take a chance and re place my order since the website was showing 3 available.  I placed my order last night and sure enough, I just got a confirmation email that my size 11 Kamandas just shipped.

277,Review of the Adidas UltraBOOST ATR (All-Terrain),"PIC: https://imgur.com/a/dENwhVk

Hey just wanted to leave my honest review of this shoe as there is a bit of confusion online particularly around the sizing and what this shoe is so wanted to clear it up from an honest users perspective. 




SIZING: True to size/Half size up, DO NOT GO DOWN HALF A SIZE, on RunningWarehouses website/multiple youtubers and several online reviews have said they went down half a size, disregard that completly this is a true to size/half size up shoe only. 

I had to choose between down half a size and up half a size and went with down but I regret it, even with the insole out its still not right


TRACTION: The traction is actually no different than the regular UB, you'd think from the marketing and the size of the rubber it'd be better but its the same, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but wet grass and icy conditions definitely watch your step. 


Quality: Superb quality, extremly thick and durable outsole, luxioursly padded heel area + the knit upper its a dream to use (if you have the right size ):  


Breathability: Low, this is a warm shoe designed for colder temperatures, in the summertime this will definitely get too hot. Temperatures under 15 celsuis its perfect, above that I'd use another shoe. 


All-terrain abilitities: Mostly just marketing talk, this is almost strictly a road shoe, just think of the ATR version as a warmer UB with a more durable outsole and you'll be happy. 



Wet Weather protection: Better than an UB, will handle light rain and snow well, but knit is knit, don't be silly and you won't be dissappointed.



Conclusion/TL:DR: Insanely durable warmer UB that fits tighter than a normal version, true-to-size or half size up ONLY!!",adidas,1547832547,nothrowaway4me,4,1,True,2019-01-18

I am new to the ""shoe business"" and I just wanted to ask a question.

I would like to get these new Son Gohan shoes from adidas that got released today. Maybe they will be in the mass-production, but I don't think so, so here is my question.

Does someone of you have experience with buying limited shoes? Because I would like to buy the shoes in a few months for a few more bucks on maybe eBay or other platforms, do you think that I will be able to buy NEW shoes in a few months from e.g. maybe people that just buy them to sell them for more or will they be completely unavailable?

147,What are you people doing?,"The stage 2 dragon Ball z shoes (cell vs Gohan) were announced earlier this month to be released on October 27th. 2-3 days before the release date they move it forward a day so that it will be released on October 26th at 10:00 am. If you move a release date up it is usually expected that the product is all ready to be released and their will be no problems. Not only was this not the case but they moved it back to the original date again. Which is fine whatever things happen. But why remove them from the online store? Why the fuck would you remove a highly valued product from the online store ONLY IN AMERICA BY THE WAY EVERYWHERE ELSE GOT THEM ONLINE. Why the fuck are the pharell shoes that nobody wants on the store but the Dragon ball shoes that will most likely make triple the profit not?

""So what? In store isn't that bad. Just get up and drive there."" Except only stored around in the fucking 15th century will get them. The closest one to me is in fucking New York which is an 8 hour drive. 

The biggest problem to me is the fucking lying that went on through the last 2 days from customer service. Everyone contradicted each other, I called yesterday they said in store only. I called again yesterday and they said online only. I called again today online again and an hour ago I called again and its in store only. How fucking hard is it to send a fucking memo to your customer service representatives? 

Also why the fuck is this stage different? Everyone says this is the best set so why the fuck was the first one online and this one wasn't? The Frieza ones were still in stock a week before these were going to drop because they were so ugly. Why are the best ones (that sold out instantly over seas by the way) not online?

The America branch of this company is a fucking joke. Usually a brand will sacrifice pleasing fans for maximizing profit or vice versa, but no smart person can say that by limiting the releases even more than they already were will make them any more money.

If anyone else has been following this saga you may remember that last weekend I went through a hell of s wasted morning trying to get those Cell propheres that were supposed to drop last Saturday. 

They were postponed to this weekend so as not to compete with the new Yeezys. Being the hypebeast I am, I again woke up early on a Saturday to go to the Times Sq flagship store and see if they had them as phone calls weren't leading me anywhere. 

Of course they still do not have it. Postponed again this time I have not been given a reason nor a potential release date. They simply pointed me to their app and told me to sign up for the Creators club for the exclusive updates regarding future releases - the very same app which has no product page for ANY of the DBZ sneakers, including those already released.

Fuck adidas. If anyone who's signed up for creators club has any idea what's going on regarding this I'd greatly appreciate a heads up.
