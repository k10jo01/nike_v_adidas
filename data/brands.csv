2,Sizing question on buying men’s for women. Sizing for Nike Graviton sneakers.,"Soo I had been eyeing the women’s Nike Air Max Graviton in white but Nike seems to only sell it in men’s. Normally I’m a size 9 in women US and 7 in men US. Although the last time I bought my women’s Nike TNs a 9.5 was the best fit considering I also have a wide foot. 

I was going to order a 7.5 just to be sure but I have been reading that men’s shoes tend to be wider anyway and have a larger toe box. If so should i just stick to a 7 than a 7.5? Or is the safest best just to get the 7.5?",Nike,1568443108,buzzbuzzbih,3,0,True,2019-09-14

7,Nike.com gift card ridiculous policies!,"Last year in November I received 2 gift card of $500 HKD from my wife.   I figured it's September now it's time to use it before it expires.  
 

What happened was the shittiest online ordering experience ever.

First, apparently I can't use 2 gift cards at once in the same order.  If I buy a pair of shoes for $1200 I can only use 1 card.  Which means I have to pay $700 to get the pair of shoes I want, and find another $500 worth of product to finish up the last card.

Secondly, I input the gift card information and decided to not place the order at the checkout (ie refresh the page because I couldn't find an option to use 2 cards at once), the next time I entered the card info, it displays I have $0.00 left on the card balance.  Naturally I called customer service and I was told once I input the card information, their system will hold my money for 24 hours regardless I place the order or not.   

When I asked your customer service over the phone what happens when the gift card expires while my fund is being held, she just said unfortunately the fund will be lost.

Someone please verify with me on these information, I would like to know for sure if I was just misinformed by an lazy customer service representative.  Otherwise, this has to be the crappiest gift card system I've ever seen from a large company.",Nike,1568532065,danhoyuen,6,4,True,2019-09-15

26,Nike Returns Policy,"Now the new football (soccer) season has now started I wanted to get a new pair of boots but £200+ is a fee I'd rather not pay. Then i came across the returns policy:
&gt; We design our shoes and gear to help you perform at peak level, so if they're not working exactly right for you, we've got you covered. When you buy on Nike.com, we provide you 30 days from the delivery date to take your Nike or Hurley purchases for a trial run, confidently knowing you can return (or exchange) any item (some exceptions apply) for any reason within 30 days. That even includes custom Nike By You sneakers. No questions asked and no delivery costs for NikePlus Members. And after 30 days, you can still return items if they're unworn and unwashed.

So go ahead, shop with confidence and enjoy your 30-day, risk-free trial.

From my understanding this means that I can buy a pair of boots, train and play in them for 25ish days, return them (most likely not in a resellable condition), receive my refund and buy another new pair, then rinse and repeat for the whole season.

I had a chat with a friend today who said that one of his friends did this last season so he basically had a new pair of boots every month and Nike never stopped him. At face value this would suggest I'm fine to do the same and have new boots each month and return them at the end of that month but I find it hard to believe that Nike won't suspend me from returning items if I continue to buy and return the same item (potentially different CW but still) each month. If I think about it from their perspective, they have no reason not to stop me from doing this; it's not like they're going to lose a customer if they do so, and I'm pushing my luck by doing this so I can't really angry if they do lol.

If you've exploited their returns policy like this or in a similar way please reply with your experiences, whether you've been banned/suspended or warned by Nike or never had an issue, I'm very interested to hear if anyone else has done this. Cheers",Nike,1568843997,owxnw14,2,0,True,2019-09-18

This is last year model and it cost around 280€ but since they are last year model they have a discount on many Nike sites that I checked (Germany, Ireland, UK,...) but on mine, Croatian site there is still the original price of 280€. So, new Mercurial **7** came out and they are also listed for the same price. I have waited a few days but still, I don't see any shift in the price of old models on the Croatian site, every other has discount as I said.

What should i do? Return them and get 1 size bigger (sadly i cant go half a size up because between 41 and 42 EU there isnt a 41,5) or just keep wearing them so they give in? Anyone with vapormax's that can tell me what to do?

I heard people say that you should go for 1 size bigger with vapormax's anyway but im not sure about that because that will result in me having about 1 and a half up thumb space empty in the front. Or is that how they are supposed to be? Can someone who wears them tell me what to do?",Nike,1570867035,Lesi159,1,1,True,2019-10-12

I’ve seen products on the Nike website that I liked, but I really liked the thumb holes on the hoodie that I have and didn’t see any like that on the Nike website. It has a separate part that is not part of the cuff that covers the hand. I would really like to have something like this again.

192,Are they too small or is it okay?,"Hi there! 

So I purchased some Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe in a size 7 (typically my size) when they were on sale last week, online. I've been saving up to buy a nice sneaker because I am on my feet a lot and have a big trip coming up.  I usually buy whatever the cheapest costco sneaker is and it's been perfectly fine till now.

I thought I'd splurge a little on a basic Nike sneaker.  I think I got the pair for $60~.  

My only concern is I got them in and I've been walking around in them and it does seem like they might be too small.  It actually fits REALLY WELL everywhere except the tip of my toe.  I'm a bit surprised how awesome everything else feels.  I thought there was a little room left but as I am walking in them through the day, my toe nails have gotten kinda achey.  

I think the sale is over so I was wondering if you guys think it'd be okay if they ""break in""?  Will they stretch out a little you guys think?  

I don't think the Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe comes in a 7.5...but I actually can't find this shoe on the website anymore (i might be blind).  

I'm in a weird time in my life right now so I can't really afford anything better so it would be great if maybe these would stretch out a bit.  I'm being very careful with my money right now.

Any suggestions of another style would be great!  Basically looking for the most budget shoe Nike offers (really impressed by the cushion on this pair) that will help my feet walking around for 8-9 hours a day.  I can spend upwards of $80 but it's a bit of a stretch for me, so that's why I was so happy to catch the Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe on sale last week.

198,Heel Slip on Metcon 5 X. What do,"Hi guys. So I was in the hunt for some Romaleos 3 XD for gym but I realised how much of dedicated lifting shoe they are that the sales person turned me to the Metcon 5's. I do a lot more than lifts in the gym and while not a dedicated lifting shoe, thought it would me the versatility I need.

So I bought them retail. US 9, the same as every single other pair of Nike shoes I own. I tried thick and thin socks and got mad heel slip. The forefoot of the shoe felt perfect but the heel slipped on every single stride.

Went back to the store and modified the lacing pattern a bit which helped, but damn son, it was still there. They didn't have 8.5's but I tried 8's on kicks and the heel slip stopped so I'm putting this down to sizing.

It's so odd. I've never had this before on any nike shoes. I know that the heel line is a bit lower on Metcons, never owned them before, but I couldn't wear them to the gym with what I was getting. The hyperlift insert made it slightly worse.

I'll give more info. I'm not a shifty, fancy, cross you up kind of point guard, I'm a simple set people up, drive to the basket and lay it in kind of guy. I often relate myself the most to Marcus Smart. Meaning I also play really good clamp and sticky defense, so I need shoes that flow with me and help me stick with people. 

I've previously played in Lebron 15's and Kyrie 5's. The 15's in my opinion were some of the best shoes I've ever played in. They could be a bit heavy sometimes, but they felt great on my feet and helped maximize my play. Kyrie 5's on the other hand, a bit disappointed with. I found myself not playing as good of defense in them, and I often felt like I was slipping on ice when driving a lane.

289,Nike we got a problem here,"This is a problem with Nike’s uniforms in college and professional sports. Now before you start mentioning anything, no this is not going to be a political post. And I’m not trying to troll, I’m trying to provide suggestions for anyone who might know Nike dealers or anyone who makes uniforms with Nike.

But Nike, what is your deal with screwing up uniforms in both college and professional sports?

There are very few circumstances that a new designed Nike uniform in sports looks good. Take Clemson’s retro football uniform as one of the few examples.

What’s the exact problem with Nike? Let’s start out with

1. Coloring
Nike you have a problem with dark colors. What’s wrong with royal blue man? How about orange, or maybe powder blue? Take Ole Miss’ college football uniforms (I’m not an ole miss fan), they’re fine but they’d look so much better if they weren’t navy blue. So many teams have navy blue, it’s the least original color there is. And take the Miami Dolphins jersey before the touchup. Why would you include like a dark blue lining there? What was the point? Why did you get rid of the orange? And with the lakers, why did you change the color to banana yellow? Do us a favor, and stick with the colors that are already provided. Don’t change them, don’t add anything new, stick with the old colors.

2. Trying to incorporate their own design
Look I get that you want to make teams unique, like Syracuse with gradients, or the seahawks with that weird helmet design, but what people prefer is simpler classic looking jerseys. How many people do you see complaining about the cowboys uniforms, the crimson tide, or the Celtics classic greens? Every year, the lowest ranked jerseys in college football, professional football, and professional basketball are the ones that have too much going on or trying to incorporate their own “new” look.

And probably the most important one
3. What’s your problem with block style numbers?

Seriously did a kid wearing a block style jersey bite your balls off as a kid? There’s nothing wrong with keeping the numbers in the standard football font. Every now and then a different font looks good on a particular jersey (IE Bears, Steelers maybe), but 99% of the fonts Nike creates to add flair look very shit.

I don’t want to rat on Syracuse again but their old uniforms in college football had the most disgusting number font. You’ve made LSU’s font look like it was put through a taffy puller. You make the Dolphins numbers look like a malnourished child. You made the seminoles numbers look like they could rip my finger off just touching a jersey. 

Block style numbers aren’t bad, simplicity and the classic “football” looking uniforms are what people prefer. Pitt’s and Syracuse’s new uniforms this season are a step in the right direction, and even the Detroit Lions look alright, but you fucked with the numbers again on all 3. Please stop with that shit. 

Nike, just keep the classic colors, don’t try to add some “unique” flair to a uniform that doesn’t need it, and stay away from any number font that’s not a form of block style

* wanted to buy new shoes, sounds easy and nike even makes an app for that.
* ordered custom shoes and order gets canceled for unknown reasons
* try to reorder shoes with a customer service rep and give my CC over the phone and i was told i cannot buy the shoe i wanted because the custom shoes i wanted are no longer available. (thats right fokes, * * you think you are making custom shoes but in reality they just make a bunch of different colors and dont release them until ordered) this also means they run out and you cannot get them anymore.
* select a different shoe order them and still my order gets canceled (OMG are you serious)
* i reorder after creating a new account and guess what the shoes are not available.
* i talk to customer service and they give me 2 promo codes (20% off and free next day shipping)i was explicitly told to use the promo codes together.
* i pick out new shoes and go to use the promo codes and i am not able to use both together (@at this point i am buying 6 pairs of off the shelf shoes and 3 customs)
* i call customer service and they say a manager will call me back in 2 hours
* i wait and guess what one of my shoes that are custom made are no longer available
* i call back and i was told the same thing give them an hour or so to get free and a manager will address all my issues
* i wait again ( lost another shoe) ugh .. .
* i get irritated with waiting and end up with using one 1 promo code
* i call back and get another rep that tells me well if they cancel the order they can apply both promo codes ( i declined because i am not loosing the last custom shoe i made)
* i was told they will have a manager call me back with in an hour
* next day told the same thing
* i contacted support 9 times over the course of the day, never once getting to a manager and now i am being told that i will not receive a call back until 1-2 days of business and they never guarantee that it will be a call or within an hour.

**** i am just done..... *****
after all of this and still get no customer service
there is a 90% chance that they will end up getting there shoes back and i will just go to ADIDAS

note: here is one of the several chat transcription guaranteeing a call or email back:
customer service Rep: Thanks! There is no available manager as of the moment but no worries, I will escalate this concern to our Elite Team and we will call/email you within 2-4 hours.

Could it be too weak and rip very easily? I don’t doubt Nike in their design but it honestly looks like it is going to rip if you pull it a bit harder when putting them on. Let alone run every day.

I ordered 2 pairs of Nike shoes from Zalando (Epic React Flyknit 2 vs Odyssey React Flyknit). I paid \~ $80 for Epic's and \~ $87 for Odyssey's. I will be using them mostly for walking long distances, as I'm going to travel a lot during my holidays and also running from time to time. I will be visiting many warm countries (Portugal, Spain etc.) but also few colder ones (Switzerland, Netherlands). I can't decide which shoes are better for that. The trip will be without any stop and that's why I need good shoes. Could you help me? Which pair would you choose?

I'd have 2mm of space with the left foot, and 6mm on the right. If I chose a 7.5, I'd be short 2mm on left and have 2mm free on right.

Any advice on which to go for? I've never worn Jordan's so have no idea of the fit, and I'm ordering online.

1. A nike logo (I'm not sure but maybe nike flight logo? haven't been able to find one like this)

An other issue is the fact that if I go for longer than 15K in them, they aren't comfortable anymore and I get some sore feet afterwards, it's not so bad but it is also not really uncommon for me to go over 15 kilometers a day

894,I'm having a really bad experience with Nike returns and am not sure if it's even going to be resolved,"I received a pair of Nike Komyuter SE shoes at the beginning of January and was truly hyped as they look perfect on the outside. Unfortunately, to me, the pair I have is defective as the lace mechanism literally unties itself as soon as make two steps. The size I ordered is identical to the size of my previous nikes, which are the most comfortable and fitting shoe I own. The older model has normal ties, which do not loosen in any way, and I simply love wearing them. Unfortunately, the Komyuters are the opposite and they feel like they will fall of my shoes after the very first steps I take with them, regardless of how tight I make them. The mechanism does not hold the laces at all and simply loosens as soon as you move your feet in the shoes. I contacted Nike about it and they said the shoe should be ordered 1 size below your normal size - something that is not indicated anywhere in the description. This is not really true, because at the same time I ordered 1 pair smaller Komyuters from a different shop, as this size was no longer available from Nike official. And what do you know, it fit kind of better, but the mechanism was the same crappy design that loosens itself as soon as you start walking. To me, the whole design of this model is defective as the little mechanism that holds the ties at the back of the shoe is incapable of holding them and lets go as soon as you move your feet. What's funny is that the smaller shop honored my return request, sent me a DHL pick up for free, and refunded me within a week. Something Nike is seemingly incapable of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I contacted Nike at the start of January and they sent me the first return label. I live in the Balkans, EU and since it was delivered by DHL, I presumed I need to personally go to a DHL office and let them scan the label and pick up the box as no further explanation was given except the label and a ""preferred pickup date"". That was the first waste of time I went through, as DHL explained this is not their label and there's nothing they can do (and their office is at the other end of the city...). I contacted Nike and they explained to me for the very first time that it's a pickup they do with a different delivery company, one which never arrived nor contacted me in any way to seek me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward through Janury and the beginning of February and 3 more return labels have been issued for me, of which NONE were picked up - no contact over the phone, no nothing. I waited at my office all day long without leaving the premises for 3 different days and felt like and idiot that was simply lied to. It seems they only issued return labels but never sent anyone to pick them up, which is ridiculous as I had only heard good things about their support.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, after they did not respond to my last request for an actual resolution to this issue in days, I wrote to them that I will be contacting my bank and card issuer to seek help from them in any way I can. I've honestly had enough. Thankfully, the shoes were purchased during a period where the return limit is increased to 60 days, but it seems Nike has no interest to resolve this given what has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if anyone has had such an experience but I honestly can't recommend this shoe, or the nike online shop to anyone after going through it. And I am not sure if a chargeback would be possible, but in my experience I paid a premium price for a defective pair of shoes that untie themselves instantly after you start walking.",Nike,1550557953,b_fnk,2,1,True,2019-02-19

# INSIDE THE VAULT

##### THE STORY OF SAFARI

For Tinker Hatfield, ideas are a culmination of all your experiences and interactions up until that point. Anything and everything is of inspiration. Take for example, the 1987 Nike Air Safari. At the time, Tinker knew what he wanted to do with the shoe that introduced Safari print to the world, but how it was going to be done was still up in the air.  


“I had this feeling that luxury, comfort and the idea of taking an athletic shoe and purposely making it non athletic was a good idea”, Hatfield shared as he reminisced on the Nike Air Safari. “So I drew this up and presented it but I didn’t even have any materials chosen. I jumped on a plane to New York City and was just roaming around. I remember I went into this furniture store, the kind that you have to get buzzed in.""

I walked through the basketball section of my local sports store and noticed how utterly ugly basketball shoes have gotten with no obvious tech upgrades. I’ve been out of school for 3 years now thus never having a need to go out and buy new cleats or shoes to replace my worn footwear. I remember the Hyperfuse material, Nike Flywire tech, Flyknit, the bags of air etc and how truly revolutionary all of it was.

I own 2 pairs of Nike hyper dunk 2012 (low and a high), and hyper dunks 14-15 high and 16 low (in my opinion the 2012 hyperdunk low is by far the greatest hyperdunk yet, nothing about it from traction, upper quality and stitching, weight, fit, or aesthetic etc is flawed). I own Jordans 28-30 all of which are absolutely fantastic shoes, and revolutionary in their own regards (maybe not the 30 but the 28 and 29 for sure). I own magistas, and mercurials top of the line for their respective year, I own multiple vapours for football and just recently replaced my old hockey skates with top of the line baur nexus 1n skates. 

I look at all of these footwear and I can’t help but feel like we’re peaking in terms of tech. Maybe not so much hockey skates, but the tech being used on football cleats, soccer cleats and basketball shoes are almost a decade old. Basketball shoes are hideous now a days with no new tech. Like in what way can you improve on the Jordan 29? That shoe was perfect! How could you possible beat a fully flyknit upper? The traction was absolutely ridiculous and the rigidity was perfect. I can’t help but feel Nike and other sports companies are trying desperately to save and spread out old tech because the sports wear industry has peaked tech wise.

I thought the High Vandal Supremes might be good bcs they're a softer material but I'm very concerned about breath-ability. Also the price, what with being out of work.

I can't tell if high tops would be better because that portion of the foot is tied in tight or if it would be worse bcs of all the additional tongue contact. Ditto a big, plushy tongue.

1075,Newbie looking for advice for a pair of sneakers,"Hey there ! As part of my 2019 resolutions, I decided to buy new sports gear to try and be more consistent about it. I try to run once to twice a week, in the street and wanted to get a pair of sneakers from Nike (or Adidas as a second choice).

I was told the perfect fit for me would be the model Nike Air Pegasus. Another person told me the Nike Air Zoom Structure 21 would probably be just as good and also appears to be on sale right now.

What are your thoughts on those two pair of shoes ?

Also, I'm trying to get into basket-ball a little bit (I play outside) and have seen an interesting offer in another shop for a pair of Jordan Relentless Nike or some Nike Air Versitile with some other shoes.

What about those, are those good for playing basket-ball ? What's the difference between all those sneakers ?

As a result I ended up cutting and pulling out quite a bit of the fabric itself, so now theres quite a few marks and missing bits on the side of the tracksuit bottoms.

1161,Honest opinion about nike support,"Hey i just want to share my experience with you, and ask for your help, read through this if you are a sneaker expert or have had any good/bad experiences with customer service,

So about an hour ago i contacted nike support with a complaint about a Nike Air Jordan 1 Mid, and how the retailer i bought it from didnt really care, it had warranty tho.

So i tried to tell them everything that was wrong with the shoe, like: (pictures will be below)

 **Jen**: Aside from this concern, will there be anything else?   
**Farkas**: you guys made that sneaker, and after 2 weeks, the glue of the artificial leather resolved, because of raindrops  
**Farkas**: the jordan 1 mid sneaker had bubbles on it only because rain  

Extra funny: even 2 of my friends told me that they had the exact same problem with exactly the same shoe

So the support lady just dodged all my bullets, and then shut the chat down.

1. It's not normal that a sneaker falls apart because some drops of rain.
2. I didn't ever have high hopes for these capitalist companies,

BUT 

when i had the same problem with LEGO:

I bought a minifigure pack,that had a broken piece in it, and i had a kind of similar chat with a lego assistant, they sent me a brand new packet right after. Not a replacement piece! A pack!

If you want i can show pictures about that too.

SO, that really grinds my gears, how they just tried to ignore my complaint. I know that it's a profit oriented company, but sometimes they should care about their customers because not everyone could afford another €170 shoe, especially here in hungary. (&lt;- worst country in eu xd), I will probably try to write to the consumer protection agency, but here its also pretty poor.

Any bad experience of yours with support

3526,Nike should turn footwork into artwork..and how this put me in the hospital,"This is a fairly long story.  Let me explain my idea first.

I call it Foot Scribbling.  This idea popped in my head in the Winter about 8 years ago or so, I ran down a parking lot that had been covered in a light snow and slid lines into the surface and made a diamond shape.  I live in the Northeast US and for the next few years spent a lot of time experimenting with this idea.  I'm a avid runner and would be out in the Winter showing up to parking lots and later to cinder paths and using all the footwork drills I've learned, making patterns and textures and getting some results.  Icky shuffle, spins, backpedals, turns, skips.  Letting the residual lines turn into artwork all left on the ground.  

I also started to contact various figures at local universities and trying to get more information on whether this was done before.  Ya know, just whether there was anything similar.  I ended up getting some feedback.  A professor at one of the local universities filled me in on a theatre production called ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.""  It was a play where a spelling bee contestant uses his feet to spell the words on the ground.  It was whimsical, imaginary, and not nearly as edgy as my interpretation of this concept.  So the idea isn't wholly original, but it never stopped me from pursuing more information and I ended talking about this concept to other people with movement experience or a strong business acumen.  

From there it hit me, what if Nike made a pair of shoes that someone could put on where they could walk out their door onto pavement or blacktop and create artwork.  I had surmised that if the artwork was water-soluble and impermanent it would appeal to the masses.  Maybe there is a cartridge of some sort that you put in the shoe, I'm not entirely sure.  This is where I naturally came into a stopping point.  I don't have Phil Knight or Tinker Hatfield as contacts but I figured Nike is the best company to engineer the shoe and market it.  And if there was such a shoe that existed, would you really question as to whether people would buy it?  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that if a shoe existed, and it legitimately gave people the ability to create artwork with their feet that they would buy it.  

I had stretched this idea as far as I could and over time had contacted and discussed my concept with 3 Ivy League business graduates/consultants.  The input I had received was always positive.  It isn't a perfect concept, but what I believe to be a possible concept.  Engineering a shoe such as this is undoubtedly not easy.  

It is a form of movement that would likely better one's proprioception and footwork.  If someone could walk outside and made like 8 lines that turned into a bird or something fairly simple it would probably be pretty cool.  If you were a breakdancer, basketball player or ballerina it would likely interest you as a mover to be able to buy a pair of shoes that helped you with footwork where you could also make shapes and gave you feedback.  

If you can imagine my idea watch Les Twins on Youtube and visualize those two dancers with this pair of shoes.  They are brilliant movers and I'm convinced they could really bring this to life.  Just watch their feet.

So I think you understand my idea.  It isn't the hardest concept to grasp.  And this is where the story goes for a twist.  

So January of 2017, I contact one of my old classmates at Springfield College in MA.  We talked on the internet and videochatted about the idea and I told him I wanted to pitch my idea at the school.  Being a graduate of Springfield College and knowing the history of the school, it just made the most sense.  Springfield College is the birthplace of basketball, an alum invented volleyball and they have ties everywhere in the sports world.  I was just getting ready to draft an email and seek out the most likely professors for feedback.  It was the easiest point of entrance.  And then, by chance I spot on my feed on Instagram two trainers on the internet imitating my idea in sand.  Both with huge followings and connected to a company that's mission is to bring movement to life through technology.  Mind you I was already suspicious of the local world threading itself into my IG feed and convinced that there was a way you could subliminally message through the feed.  I immediately contacted my classmate and told him that I thought my idea was submitted.  Mind you other members of the company and their trainers were interacting with my feed the next two months and liking the pictures I was posting.  I became convinced my idea had been submitted by this third-party.  They were simulataneously showing up on my feed while I was getting interaction from the companies trainers on my IG.  Mind you the same company is also the most represented Yoga platform on IG, and I was in the middle of developing a pretty strong yoga practice myself.

It almost appeared as if my idea had been submitted so naturally I seek out the two people whom will help me the most if this were true.  My brother and my therapist.  My brother is a intellectual property lawyer and my therapist just happens to be a business consultant with an ivy league degree whom also has experience in Intellectual property.  I'll never forget scheduling that appointment with my therapist and showing him that video on Instagram and him looking at me and believing me.  My brother believed me initially too.  So there I go screenshotting the history of my feed and highly suspicious of the people whom I thought submitted it.  And there they were on my feed, feeding my bias simultaneously.  It was like a perfect storm.  

I will also note that it seemed believable that the people within this grouping knew because I had actually mentioned my idea in strong detail to other parties heavily involved with this other group.  People that know of me more than anything.  It is a small enough community around here that it really seemed convincing.  People I'd run into at any local coffee shop or down the street and because of the circumstances I never really involved myself too much with them.  Then I'd reload my IG feed and they'd show up with some of the oddest posts at the time that convinced me further they had done something. 

So I talk to the people I trust initially, for the most part try to keep it hush hush and wait for what I thought was a representative or someone from the company to show up and talk to me.  And last April I'm just waiting, and waiting, and waiting all the while posting things to my IG account that I thought would garner appropriate attention.  And oddly enough it did.  I didn't even hashtag the waterfalls I was posting and then receiving enough attention to my IG account from much of the yoga world on IG.  Which furthered me into thinking that it must be sorta known and they must be clarifying whose idea it was since I didn't actually submit it myself.  Mind you over the next 6-8 months my account had increased exposure and attention, I was followed by a Nike trainer, somebody wrote money on the picture I put out of my family, and the things showing up on my feed were just so odd.  It's like going down a rabbit hole that built this confirmation bias in my mind that confused and convinced me more than anything that this was happening.

And in truth I always thought I was talented enough to be on the IG platform and train.  That is how people perceive me, as an athlete.  I don't exaggerate my talents as an athlete but I was getting into press handstands, my arm balances were coming along and I was talking to someone about becoming a yoga teacher.  I'm also a very talented runner and jumper.  Never was gonna make the olympics, but I'm 5'9 and was basically dunking basketballs in my prime.  I was and am a pretty decent athlete.  Played college football, ran college track.  Learned yoga with literally no experience and excelled to the point of being a very strong practitioner with a lot of room to get better.  And, I was.  I was honestly convinced that I was being taken on by this platform on the internet and they had received my idea from a third-party who I was waiting to come out of the woodworks.  I would be wrong.

I had essentially said nothing for many of the coming months and my brother at some point must of poked enough holes to realize it wasn't exactly true.  His explanation was simple, if someone from Nike had been contacted they'd have contacted you.  Through all the things I was seeing on social media my vision became blurred.  At this point I find it kind of hilarious that I didn't listen to my brother.  He only graduated at Summa Cum Laude from law school and was receiving strong praise in the law world, mind you he literally reads and makes decisions on these types of things on a professional and regular basis, so I should have halted my preconceived notions on the situation and just realized I was wrong.  Nobody wants to hear from their brother that he believes they're delusional.  The unfortunate thing is I was gripped by the things I was seeing on my feed and thinking they had all these meanings that I was interpreting, which is a dangerous game to play on Instagram.  I also was talking to my brothers girlfriend about this who happens to be a law student at Yale and I wouldn't say I convinced her, but she wasn't telling me that I was obviously full of sheeeet.  It was just so weird.  I was convinced there was this big legal mishap and that they had submitted my idea as being one of the originators themselves so the company couldn't properly give credit to me.

I waited, and waited, and waited.  And was following my feed for literal feedback and come to the conclusion that the same people that had submitted my idea were now turned against me for not seeking them out.  I basically in my own mind put myself out there just enough to seem like I was cooperating with this group.  Or willing to cooperate even though there was many reasons for which I would not want to.  My mind ended up building explanations where I needn't build explanations.  So the two girls whom I thought submitted it, I all of a sudden thought they were trying to ruin me which was like April of this year.  The group whom I thought submitted it were turned against me and I was screenshotting everything.  I mean 1000's of screenshots from the follwing year.  All supporting this alter-universe from the social media platforms.  It's like I don't even want to get into the things that I saw.  So someone with which I thought knew what was going on I had mistakenly emailed thinking while she is just waiting for this to happen and I thought she knew.  I had tried to have humility and not toot my own horn as the person that just invented this so I never said anything to her and then the last two months all these things came up and I ended up sounding like a crazy person.  I sprained my elbow and tried to plead my case while she met with me to tell me this wasn't happening.  I ended up not believing her and was convinced she was trying to keep me quiet until everything was worked out.  I ended up sending two emails which to this day I'm more embarrassed and ashamed of then I've ever been.  It's like I thought the group whom submitted it were trying to plant this #metoo movement on me and I flipped out.  I'm not Kavanaugh, and in some hilarious way it was nothing.

Low and behold that same person whom I emailed called the cops on me.  I remember going out on a Friday morning with these bags from my closet and just like in the weirdest place in my life.  Two cops approach me and I got sent to the Psychiatric evaluation unit.  I spent 13 days in the hospital convinced all these things were happening and it took me like another 3 weeks to believe they weren't.  It was really an incredibly embarrassing experience and I just really wish I never saw the trainers imitating my idea in the sand spinning about.  I was naive, no doubt about it.  In hindsight it was probably the right thing to do considering I sounded like a crazy person when I really think about the contents of the email and what I was otherwise saying.    

There are numerous things I'm leaving out for which I might be able to explain.  I just wanted to leave names and certain details out because it isn't appropriate especially considering I was just building this story in my head.  I got rid of my social media accounts and holed myself up for months too embarrassed to walk out the door.  I don't consider myself too irrational or lacking complete intuition when it comes to people.  I'm widely misunderstood by some people but I usually read into things with some accuracy.  And while I don't like getting on the mental illness train I was diagnosed with OCD while I was in the psych unit.  Something I already knew about myself.  I mean it was odd enough talking to someone in the unit who watched me play football growing up and verbatim when he took me out of the unit looked at me and sarcastically said ""don't beat me up.""  It's because my reputation with people is that I'm a very good athlete and that was one of the opposing coaches that I played football against in high school.  

Just the whole experience is weird and still is.  And truthfully I want to know if other people can imagine the concept.  Do you think Nike could make this shoe?  Would you try it?  Would you want those shoes?  Do you think it's possible someone could get so misled by social media?  Do people need more of an explanation around the third party of people whom I thought submitted?

I'll answer questions best I can.  The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and I wish I had went to Springfield before I saw that on Instagram.  It was this weird syncronicity that royally messed with my head.  And I had actually posted pics of the artwork on on feed which is another weird detail.  I didn't post videos but I did post pics of the results.  I made this feather working on the press handstands that to this day I think could be replicated and I could teach.  No matter.

3533,Bad experience at Nike factory store. Were they justified?,"I bought a pair of shoes on Tuesday. Today (Friday), I went there again to shop for another pair. I saw they had a 20% additional sale off the lowest markdown item. I happened to have the receipt for the item I bought on Tuesday. I also had the empty box in the back of my car. So I thought great, I'll get a price adjustment. Employee X asked the manager if they can do this. He said no. I told employee X ok what if I return it and buy it right back? She said you can do that, but might risk the original price of the shoes having gone back up. I said ok can you check what the price would be today? She clicked some keys on her keyboard and said the price would be the same as Tuesday's. In other words, she was saying leading me to believe that the item's lowest ticket had gone up, and the 20% discount would bring it back to Tuesday's price. I had a feeling she wasn't being truthful. So I went to the back of the store, grabbed an identical pair on the wall, and asked another unsuspecting manager (Manager Y) to give me a price check. Manager Y was very cordial. She confirmed what I knew. The quoted price was lower. Employee X had lied to get rid of me. I went to get the shoe box from my car and my receipt. Manager Y happened to be at the cash register to ring people up. I went and asked to return my shoes and buy it right back. Suddenly her demeanor changed and she was no longer nice. She was being argumentative with me saying ""you can't do that"". Finally, she went ahead and did it. This was just outrageous.

3606,Cross Training Comparison (Nike Free x Metcon X vs Nike Zoom Train Command vs Nike Free TR V8),"[Album](https://imgur.com/a/FHEB94q)

For starters... I'm not sure if the Nike Free x Metcon X is equivalent to the [Nike Free x Metcon](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-gym-cross-training-shoe-VKoLdD/AH8141-003)  which is what I tried in store. They felt very comfortable in store but [these colorways](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-x-mens-training-shoe-bjgDCK) just felt different to me.  Not sure if there's any difference or anyone else has had experience.

Three shoes tested:  

* [Nike Free TR V8 ~  Men's Gym/HIIT/Cross Training Shoe ~ $70](https://www.nike.com/t/free-tr-v8-mens-gym-hiit-cross-training-shoe-GZeoXk/AH9395-003)   
*  [Nike Zoom Train Command ~ $110](https://www.nike.com/t/zoom-train-command-mens-gym-boxing-shoe-spqPwg)
* [Nike Free x Metcon X ~ $84
](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-x-mens-training-shoe-bjgDCK)

Style: I give preference to the Nike Free x Metcon.  

Comfort: Nike Free x Metcon --&gt; Nike Free TR V8 --&gt; Zoom Train Command.  The Zoom Train commands soles are just too flat (probably why it's a boxing shoe). It wouldn't be very comfortable running or jumping or walking long distances imo. It's a pretty close though between the Nike Free TR V8 / Metcons.   
I might just end up getting the Metcons / TR V8's. 

Although I'm not digging that limited edition colorway on the metcons in person so I'll probably return those.

I am personally offended by his Jew fro and black panther starter kit. He is not from wakanda and I'm Jewish and can see a Jew from a mile away. This guy's a fraud. 

It's about this: this douche kapernik took a dick I mean knee during the national anthem in an NFL game on the in front of millions and then claimed he felt oppressed. He was a black guy half white who was raised by both white parents wealthy at that, and he sucked as a QB so he got put into backup role even tho he was still on a 100 million dollar contract. Hes a bit of a bitch so he couldn't handle being a shitty backup, so he walked away from the job. He quit. Other teams saw how much he sucked and how much he wanted to make and did not decide to hire him after he quit while taking that $$. So they didn't hire him. Remember he's a bit of a bitch right so my dude starts claiming he is oppressed and blames white people and claims to be the spokesperson for black people (hence the Jew fro and black panther leather starter kit). So then he makes commercials and Sue's the NFL once he can no longer even get them on the telephone. And then Nike makes the retarded decision to hire him for a commercial and ad campaign they are currently regretting... Because they, like most of the internet, underestimate how much real Americans don't give a fuck about you we just dont you're bushit and drama... Also, we love America and it really is equal, unless you're a bit of a bitch. 

Love it. Kap is a pos. Nike sucks. Go Trump. Maga. 

Also, Kap looks stupid with his 1970s afro and is the worst possible person other than maybe Rosie odonnel, to represent black America in their efforts to make what is already a biased system of helping blacks first even more one sided. He is rich, he grew up wealthy raised by white folks and has never been or felt oppression anymore than any other white man... And gasp white people feel oppression as well. The system is rigged to help black people, look at equal rights movements and BET... Or black history month. Where's WET... OR white history month, or white panther. Think for yourselves.

If it we're about equality, we would be having different conversations. This is about another race wanting superiority and it isn't the white race. This is also about Kap wanting to stay relevant, but he hasn't and he won't. 5 years and he dies off completely.. like Ryan Leaf.

Further, people are so incredibly butthurt about Trump taking away societies political correctness that they are looking for every outlet to frustrate him and his agenda. Maga.

3680,"What is this all about, Mr. Kaepernick?"," Let me first start by saying I fully believe that it is a person’s right to peacefully protest however they choose to do it. “Peaceful protest” is not altered because people are angered by it. If NFL players taking a knee pisses you off, that is a YOU-problem. I wish they would not do it, but they have that right. Secondly, congratulations to Mr. Kaepernick on the big Nike contract – this is what capitalism is all about.  
However, I am confused about the issues now. First it was police brutality, then it was social injustice, now it is what?  
*Let’s talk about it.*  
This movement has taken a lot of turns.  
This all began on August 26, 2016 when Colin Kaepernick decided to sit during the national anthem. After the game he said ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Then within a week, he wore socks that depicted police officers as pigs – which happens to be derogatory in nature. He associated those socks with “rogue cops.” Which is what these police officers who shoot unarmed people are – rogue. Every profession, ethnicity, community, etc … has bad apples; police officers are not immune to it. Kaepernick also followed this up with the revelation that he does not vote **and** that he had not, to that point, donated any of his money to help causes he is protesting.  
To sum it up, Kaepernick protested, then wore derogatory socks that portrayed a community as a whole but tried to say it was only meant for the few, then said he doesn’t vote, and then sad he doesn’t donate money – but he wants people to fix the problems. I’m confused too.  
Then it was showtime. Kaepernick began defending Fidel Castro’s policies. He said that Castro put more money into the education system than the prison system. That could be because Cuba did not need a prison, seeing as how they would assassinate you in your house, *in front of your kids* – but, apparently, that type of oppression can be overlooked if we throw a little extra money into the school system. Now I’m even more confused.  
Whether you agree or not, this made Kaepernick the face of the NFL protest. Now it doesn’t matter how well Malcom Jenkins handles it, this is Kaepernick’s battle and it always will be.  
Kaepernick claims to be “fight oppression of all kinds globally.” Just go look at his website.  
Nike’s checkbook may have changed that stance, though.  
Why? Well……  
In August 2018 a class action suit was filed against Nike by women. Among the allegations were:  


1. Executives were calling female counterparts “dykes” on “several occasions.”
2. A female employee started and was told her wage was “non-negotiable.” 2 months later, a male counterpart was hired to the same position but at a higher salary.
3. A male co-worker sent nude photographs to a female co-worker and followed that with more harassing text messages. After the female co-worker told the male co-worker to stop, the male co-worker began withholding information from the female co-worker. That information was imperative for the female co-worker to perform her job. The make co-worker also began skipping meetings that the female co-worker schedule and encouraged other co-workers to skip the meetings as well.
4. HR was informed of all of these incidents, but never took action.

I know what you might be saying – “these are just allegations.” That is my first response also. However, Nike publicly said they have “failed to promote enough women and minorities” and also said they have cultural issues. That is as close to an admission as you will get regarding allegations.  
What about those Nike sweatshops? Since the 1990’s Nike has used Chinese sweatshops to create their products. The workforce there, which is mostly women, works 60-84 hours a week, roughly 16 hours a day – but “earn” on average $62 a week. These shops have been criticized for using children in their factory’s and working them at the same rates for even less money. That sounds a little bit like slavery.  
How does Nike think they can be forgiven the quickest? Maybe sign Colin Kaepernick because he “fights oppression.”  
But let me ask you this Mr. Kaepernick, what about that oppression against “women and minorities?” Is it just about the money? What about Nike taking advantage of children in China to save a few dollars in the U.S.? Adidas and Puma were recruiting you for the same thing, why choose Nike when they have this type of systematic oppression going on in their own building? I thought we were fighting all social injustice here?  
A lot of this is confusing.  
But I do know one thing, if signing a multi-million dollar, multi-year deal with Nike is “sacrificing everything,” sign me up.

I only play basketball once a week and the shoes have only been worn on an indoor court, they still look practically brand new except for the defect. 

I bought the shoes from Champs and started by going there first and understandably they said it was a manufacturing issue and that Nike should handle it. So I go into a Nike store and they only want to give me a store credit for what the shoes are currently selling for ($55 since the PG 2.5 came out recently). I originally paid $110 for the shoes.

So I left the store and I called customer support and was told I would have to send the shoes in, but that I have to pay for the shipping. So my dilemma is that after paying $10-20 for shipping I’ll still probably only get the $55 store credit from Nike anyway. So I’m contemplating if I should just take their offer at the actual store and get a new pair of shoes or keep them. I can still play in the shoes but I’m worried they’re just going to get worse. 

I was wondering if anyone has had similar issues with a defective product and issues with Nike customer support and how/if it was resolved.

3767,Nike AF1 82 Authentic ?,"I was at a Church tag sale on Saturday. This church has this tag sale 4 or 5 times a year and I usually find some great stuff there to sell on ebay. There is a house or two attached to the Church and they always have a tag sale on the same day since they share a yard with the Church. Anyway in front of the house there was stuff setup like there usually was and this kid no older than 7 was selling some things. Everything was super cheap $1-$3, but most of it was in terrible condition. Anyway I saw these Nike shoes there and with the green color I figured even though it was in terrible condition maybe I could sell it on ebay for $20 or something, because I know there are people out there that buy things on ebay for other uses than they are supposed to be used. I have seen people turn things into art projects or some people just collect regardless of condition etc. Whatever thats all beside the point...

Question here is I put the shoes on ebay. At the moment I just put a placeholder price tag of $175 until I researched them a bit more, but most likely I was going to change it to $17.50 if I found out they were worth nothing. I paid $2 for these shoes. During my research someone messaged me a very nasty messaging saying I am trying to sell bootleg shoes. I have no idea why this guy is accusing me of this as I said I bought them for a 7 year old. Can someone verify if these shoes are actually authentic and what they are exactly? Thank you and as you can see I am a super amateur at this.

The caps I have with plain peaks have stitching on both sides of the peak and don't suffer from this sponginess at all.

So my question is: do Adidas make a baseball cap that has stripes on the peak that is also stitched to avoid this sponginess issue or does the addition of the stripes on the peak mean they can't do the stitching?

6427,Adidas Canada Warranty Nightmare,"I've placed several orders with [adidas.ca](https://adidas.ca) over the past couple of years and was very satisfied.  But my latest experience was horrible!

I ordered a pair of Copa Mundial Cleats for my daughter.  Within a month of use, the toe separated.  I contacted warranty and got an RA#, sent the shoes back and received confirmation from UPS that they had been received on July 30.  After waiting a few weeks, I contacted Adidas at least five times.  I had been told the issue would be prioritized, another told me it would be escalated, another told me she would personally make the warranty department aware of the issue, since it had been about 6 weeks by then that the shoes had been received by adidas.

On September 19 I was told I'd be issued a voucher as a refund.  As of today, October 1, I still had not received ANY emails from adidas about my claim, nor received a voucher.  So I called today and spent about an hour on the phone talking with one person who finally issued me a voucher.  BUT, he also said that it was only good for the purchase of a single item!  This claim had gone on so long that I had to purchase another pair of Mundials for my daughter, since she was going overseas for soccer.  I was planning to use the voucher to purchase a pair of Mundial Team Shoes for myself.and a couple of other items to make up the $200.

The voucher would not even work for the Mundial Team Shoes, as they are excluded from the promo code (voucher).  So I had to call customer service yet again.  After about 20 minutes she was able to allow me to use the voucher for the shoes.  But she also told me that my purchase had to be $200 or more, so I had to add other items to my order.  So I added two more items to make the order over $200.  Well the voucher went through, but it was indeed only for a single item.  It asked me for another $52.50 for the other items.  So I lost $50 ($40 difference in value of the voucher, plus the GST of $10 because the representative who issued the voucher could not issue the voucher for $210, only the purchase price).  I didn't really need the other two items, but I had no way of deleting the extra two items while in the checkout without risking having to start all over again and then probably finding out that my voucher had already been used.

I am 63 years old and in all my life I have never had such a terrible experience with customer service and wasted so much of my time because of a warranty issue!!!",adidas,1569951469,YUKONER777,1,2,True,2019-10-01

She wore a longline satin blazer as a dress, then added some square-toe boots and a [mesh camera bag](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525086&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donnakaran.com%2Fproduct%2Febony%2Bmesh%2Bcamera%2Bbag.do%3Fsortby%3DourPicksAscend%26page%3D2%26from%3Dfn%26selectedOption%3D566108&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seventeen.com%2Ffashion%2Fceleb-fashion%2Fg598%2Fkendall-and-kylie-best-street-style%2F) – that, FYI, is [currently on sale for $79](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525086&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donnakaran.com%2Fproduct%2Febony%2Bmesh%2Bcamera%2Bbag.do%3Fsortby%3DourPicksAscend%26page%3D2%26from%3Dfn%26selectedOption%3D566108&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seventeen.com%2Ffashion%2Fceleb-fashion%2Fg598%2Fkendall-and-kylie-best-street-style%2F). This is officially the most supermodel look I've ever seen.

In honor of National Sibling Day, Kim Kardashian shared a photo op of her and Kylie Jenner wearing matching outfits, the likes of which I have never seen before in my life. They're kind of like one-legged bodysuits that are also boots? Or like, over-the-shoulder boots? I'm not really sure what to call these. Either way, fashion has just reached another new (weird) milestone, courtesy of the Kardashian/Jenner fam.

**Tiger Blazer and a Bra**

Bras and blazers, day two! For the second time this week, King Kylie (does she still call herself that?) forgot to put on a shirt before leaving the house. She showed off a black bra at Khloe Kardashian's birthday party and wow, we have truly been blessed.

**Bra and a Blazer**

Sexy blazer looks are becoming a Kardashian/Jenner staple. Kim loves [going topless under the business casual jackets](https://www.seventeen.com/fashion/celeb-fashion/g1746/kim-kardashian-makeover/) and now Kylie's getting in on the trend. She posted a fire Instagram wearing nothing but a lacy bra under a silky maroon blazer. In related news, my smoke alarm is now going off.

**Girly Sweater and Jeans**The queen of Fashion Nova is back with another fire fit for under $100. Kylie's servin bod in a $30 fluff crop top and ass-hugging $35 jeans – both of which are still available online in almost every size. I never thought I'd have a burning desire to own a one-shoulder sweater, but alas, the power of Kylie.

Found my dream shoes, but Adidas has been continually sold out and I couldn't find them anywhere (not even many hits on Google; maybe they're rare?) save for on Poshmark. After weeks of deliberating, I decided to role the die and go for it. They just came and can't tell if I'm creating a mountain out of a molehill with the issues I'm noticing. Researched ""how to spot fakes"" all day and I'm literally 50/50 at this point. Apologies in advance for being such a noob!

Adidas page to actual shoe (best look): adidas.com/us/stan-smith-shoes/G27997.html

The main issues I've noticed are these below, but I can't tell if these differences are just inherent to a professional photoshoot vs. the real thing:

* More snakeskin-like texture on mine
* Color on mine are a tiny bit more pink-looking
* Certain trim appears to be red on mine compared to white on the website
* Some bad stitching in certain spots and small fraying
* Tried scanning barcode with various apps and returned no matching results (but again, these seem rare anyhow)
   * Note that I already checked the ART number against the box (matches perfectly) and that the shoes have serial #'s that differ in the last 3 digits (they do).

6708,Did cloudfoam change?,"About a year ago, i bought a pair of Duramos, and another pair, some kind of racer, cant remember exactly which. (Before these, I wore Adidas campus). The soles were so soft, so squishy. I remember first day i put them on, to break them i , they were just dreamy to walk on, like memory foam pillows for your feet. My job is pretty active, on my feet, so this was great.

I wore those about 6 months each. Yesterday hit the mall, bought some Asweegos. They looked similar to the racers, but better, i like that there is no seperated tongue. It has the same yellow cloudfoam keychain tab thing the other pairs came with...

...but the soles feel *nothing* alike. The other pairs started super soft, and got harder as time went on, but were still fairly soft. These Asweegos feel like BRICKS in comparison, even brand new.

6710,In love with my new Sobakovs but I need advice on sizing. Does the knit tend to stretch?,"I’m a woman who typically wears a size 8 to 8 1/2 in Adidas. However, I always find myself really liking the men’s models more so I have learned to size down to boys youth size 6 1/2 to 7. I have a recent pair of Tubular Shadows in a 7 and I regret not getting a 6 or 6.5 tbh. When I first bought them and tried them on, they fit pretty well but after some wear it seems like the knit just really loosened up.

Right now I have two pairs of Sobakovs in a 7 and a 6 1/2. The 6 1/2 fit nice and snug with thin invisible socks. The seven could definitely be worn with some thicker socks and otherwise feel pretty good. 

If I keep the 6 1/2 I’m scared that my toes may deform the shoe if I end up putting extra pressure on the balls of my feet, but they are in no way “small“. On the other hand, I’m scared that if I keep the size 7, they will end up like my Tubulars that just feel hella loose after some wear.


For anyone who has these shoes, have you noticed any extra stretching? I googled a bunch but there aren’t very many concrete answers except for the fact that the sizing of this model is a little bit confusing and many people have had to even size down one entire size.

I’m trying to not overthink this too much but because of my previous experience, I really don’t want to make the wrong choice since the triple blacks were harder to track down than I expected.

Are they durable, can they be used as everyday beaters? I'm afraid they will wear out quickly and considering the price as I said I don't want that to happen. I've also heard that the sole is thin so the boost might get damaged if you rock them too much?

I contacted adidas multiple times after that, and eventually they told me that there was nothing they can do because FedEx denied the claim.

I called AGAIN and they told me the payment was being froze but couldn't answer ANYTHING further then this, and there was noone I could talk to about getting my refund.  It was being handled ""overseas"" so there is no number to call or contact.  


So since that drop in March, it has been **MY** responsibility to find the solution to this problem (I guess by nagging them?) or they would have swept it under the rug and I would be out $300 CAD.  


Does anyone have ANY further suggestions??  My only option I can come up with is to call them weekly until this happens.

6911,Does Boost have any negative effect on the body?,"I've been wearing Boost for sometime, before it was Puma's NRGZ, since both are pretty much similar tech, i had to roll back to non-boost shoe as the Boost is waiting to be dried. I noticed that on the non-boost shoe my feet feels fatigue after a while, and after a whole day of walk awaken in the middle of the night i felt some mild back pain.

Before wearing NRGZ/Boost, i've always have tired feet but it never felt that tired, just tired, and i never had back pain, while everything felt better with Boost, i'm wondering if the softer cushion actually weakens some parts of the body so when you revert back to non-boost shoes your body cannot take it as much as before?

I'm sure you can say it's like comparing a cheap chair with a good chair, you won't go back to the cheap chair and the moment you do you felt the big difference, going back to non-boost i can clearly tell the difference but i can also remember i did not felt that bad last time. it's only less than 2 years since i wore foam type shoes. Even on flip flops for a short walk i can feel my feet are tired.

I'm just worried with the Boost, it somehow makes certain part of the body weak, similar to wearing ankle braces, while it helps reduce injury it also weakens the ankles if wore on daily basis.",adidas,1560486034,burningbun,11,2,True,2019-06-14

They  are laced, like the R1, but don't have any rigid eyelets, instead the  laces weave through holes punched directly through the mesh. They have  black &amp; white snakeskin patterned mesh and the orange vertical  stripes in the same place as both below. They do NOT have the ankle  elastic running to the midsoles like the CS2, simply connecting around  the top like the R1. All other differences are shown below.

I would attach an image of my own pair, but they are filthy and have been well loved, but not cared for properly.

Any help would be appreciated, as I've been looking and looking with no luck.

It doesn't have any kind of golden letters near the stripes or suede at the tip like the Sambas.

I threw them away cause they were pretty broken after 12 years of sports and wearing them eyery day and bought Sambas because I couldn't find them anwhere (I wouldn't wonder if they actually don't have a name). Sambas are great, but I don't like them as much as my old ones.

Adidas reccomends:

'For tight fit, go one size down.'

'For loose fit, go one size up.'  


I tried a pair of Adidas x Continental (Ultraboosts? I think?) a while ago.   
From what I remember 9 felt too snug, toes were right at the end. There wasn't a 9.5 in stock, tried 10 which was super comfortable but far too large on my feet. I bought them anyway, because they were comfortable and when I got home I realised how ridiculous they looked on my feet a size up so I returned them. They were sick but I honestly can't find them anywhere now!

&amp;#x200B;

***ANYWAY...***

As a comparison, I bought a pair of Nike Roshe 2 about a couple of years ago in a 9 and they were perfect fit.  


I always buy size 9, I've never bought any footwear in 9.5.   


I'm not particularly wide-footed, but I don't have a normal arch to my foot, it's closer to flat but it's not completely flat-footed.

7060,Adidas launches ‘Games of Thrones’ sneaker collection,"  

Good news for all the ‘Game of Thrones’. No, it’s not about winters coming or going but Adidas launching a new sneaker collection based on the hit HBO series. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wdluhkpthlo21.jpg

Based on the fantasy novel of George RR Martin, ‘Game of Thrones’ has received an overwhelming response from audiences from all the world. Adidas, after months of speculation, has officially brought a new range of sneakers for the series fans. 

The collection consists of six Ultra Boost 4.0 trainers, each design mirrors well-known elements from the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms (and the freaky White Walkers that live beyond the Wall). That means striking red with gold stripes for the Lannisters, dark grey for House Stark, icy blue for white walkers, a blend of fiery orange and black for House of Targaryen and all-black with white mudguard for Night’s Watch. Also, on the heels of the shoes are tags featuring well-known phrases from the series including “Winter is Coming”, “Winter is Here” and “Fire and Blood”. House crests are hidden away at the throat of the sneakers. So, it’s time to decide where your loyalties lie. 

[Adidas's new sneaker collection](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtnjVMEFCa4/?utm_source=ig_embed)

According to Adidas all the shoes are unisex and feature Adidas’ signature boost midsoles, a Primeknit upper for lightweight performance, and the iconic heel counter for adaptability and support. It is definitely the most comfortable way to get to support your favourite house.

Adidas which is known for its comfort and street style designs, and it’s for the first time the brand has taken out a collection blending with the popular culture. The collection comes ahead of the final season of the series.

7063,Question about primeknit sizing,So I got my pair last October and the size right off the bat always felt awkward. My toes were pressed up to the top of the shoe and you could always see the indent of the toes. I thought maybe it was because I had to break them in but nope they always felt squished. I'm not sure if wearing these caused me to get ingrown toenails or not but they always felt uncomfortable. I'm a 8.5 and everyone said to go half a size down. Would it be a bad idea to go half a size up? I accidentally bought size 10 workboots for my work and I love how much room there is and they don't slip or anything. ,adidas,1553724936,Rashidoooooo,4,2,True,2019-03-27

7071,Ultra Boost and fitting,"So after getting my first pair of Ultra Boost (the Targaryen Dragons that came with a stain! (Which I did get out with some Jason Mark’s cleaner, did a much better job getting the stain out imho than the Crep) I got the shoes all Crep Protected now and drying... wore them for a while to see how they felt, and they fit great but back heel feels sort of loose! 
I take a size men’s 14 in ASICS and Nike’s.  I thought ultraboost were true to size! I tried today a 13 ultraboost and my toe went just a a couple of mm, but they felt slightly crammed in the front of the shoe.. so I think the PERFECT booSt size for me is a half size down, and they don’t make them in 13.5.
Hoping they break in and my heel gets better grip and fit in the shoe.. feels almost like my heel is to high... 
so I am thinking since Yeezy’s run slightly smaller and I got thoses in 14, so if my ultraboost size is a 13.5 (I think they don’t make them though to try) so my Yeezy’s Geodes and Clays should fit perfect I’m hoping!

May in a few weeks cop another ultraboost in size 13 and see if they stretch and fit better? 
So anyone that has the half sizes available in the Ultra BooSt 4.0’s, I would def have gone down a half size from your ASICS/Nike. ",adidas,1553968701,johnsavv,0,2,True,2019-03-30

An other issue is the fact that if I go for longer than 15K in them, they aren't comfortable anymore and I get some sore feet afterwards, it's not so bad but it is also not really uncommon for me to go over 15 kilometers a day

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the photo for the listing on the site.](https://i.redd.it/fr75f25mpbj21.png)

I never blindly order something off a new website, so before I ordered it, I decided to read some reviews for the website. On there website it showed a 4.3 star rating. (Later, after placing my order I discovered that the 4.3 star rating seems faulty due to the fact that on multiple other websites and forums, people give the store a 2.0-3.0 star rating out of 5. ) I ordered this bag due to the fact that its an uncommon adidas bag and it was really inexpensive. $10.99, shipping would've brought it up to $19 but I found a coupon code for free shipping (most small adidas duffel bags sell for $25-$30). I've never been suspicious of my purchase until today. I was trying to log onto my account to confirm that the product will arrive today, but it wouldn't let me. I'm 100% certain that I'm using the correct password due to the fact that I have used this password to log into this account every single day since I ordered the product to track the progress. I soon noticed a label pop up as I was attempting to log in that stated there had been an update to the site that required me to reset my password! I'm like, ""okay, why would I need to reset my password due to an update?"", but I quickly brushed it off. When I attempted to reset my password it asked me to state the email that is associated with my account so that they could send me the reset link, but every time I entered my email, it says, ""please enter a valid email"". Now I probably have to call them to fix my account. You might be wondering how this leads to my question of c21stores being a scam, well your about to see right now. Although I wasn't able to log into my account to check my order progress, I was able to go to my computer history and find the tracking number (shipped with fedex). It's on it's way and says it will arrive later today based on the tracking info. Due to the fact that I wasn't able to see the product I ordered on my account (which they won't let me log into), I decided to use the site as a guest and search for the item I ordered just to freshen my memory, but when I searched it, no results were found. I then typed the name of the bag into google where it showed a listing for it on the very same site, but once I clicked into it, it said page not found or no longer exist. This isn't the only adidas bag that was removed from the site after their mysterious update. Not only that, but most of the bags that had been removed where the ones with the most likes (the ones that bring more earnings) and I don't thinks it's because they're out of stock either. They're completely gone! Do you see where thing get a little more suspicious? If not, don't worry, I'm about to sum it up. Just in case you don't know, if popular brands, such as Adidas, Popsocket, ect, see counterfeits of there products they make the lister remove the product from the site. Now you see where my suspicions come into play. This leads me to believe that the adidas bags they are selling on there site are........ COUNTERFEITS!!! Why else would there Adidas bags mysteriously disappear off of their site. If you don't believe me, here is the link to the bag on the website which will state,"" SORRY, THE PAGE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WAS NOT FOUND OR NO LONGER EXISTS.""[http://www.c21stores.com/products/diablo2smdfpurp6?CAWELAID=500002840002215003](http://www.c21stores.com/products/diablo2smdfpurp6?CAWELAID=500002840002215003)

7200,Review of the Adidas UltraBOOST ATR (All-Terrain),"PIC: https://imgur.com/a/dENwhVk

Hey just wanted to leave my honest review of this shoe as there is a bit of confusion online particularly around the sizing and what this shoe is so wanted to clear it up from an honest users perspective. 




SIZING: True to size/Half size up, DO NOT GO DOWN HALF A SIZE, on RunningWarehouses website/multiple youtubers and several online reviews have said they went down half a size, disregard that completly this is a true to size/half size up shoe only. 

I had to choose between down half a size and up half a size and went with down but I regret it, even with the insole out its still not right


TRACTION: The traction is actually no different than the regular UB, you'd think from the marketing and the size of the rubber it'd be better but its the same, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but wet grass and icy conditions definitely watch your step. 


Quality: Superb quality, extremly thick and durable outsole, luxioursly padded heel area + the knit upper its a dream to use (if you have the right size ):  


Breathability: Low, this is a warm shoe designed for colder temperatures, in the summertime this will definitely get too hot. Temperatures under 15 celsuis its perfect, above that I'd use another shoe. 


All-terrain abilitities: Mostly just marketing talk, this is almost strictly a road shoe, just think of the ATR version as a warmer UB with a more durable outsole and you'll be happy. 



Wet Weather protection: Better than an UB, will handle light rain and snow well, but knit is knit, don't be silly and you won't be dissappointed.



Conclusion/TL:DR: Insanely durable warmer UB that fits tighter than a normal version, true-to-size or half size up ONLY!!",adidas,1547832547,nothrowaway4me,4,1,True,2019-01-18

The Cells back in late October were supposed to be released alongside the Gohan shoe, but neither released on the specific date that was stated. The Gohan's got pushed back a month and released with the next couple of shoes (Majin Buu and Vegeta) but the Cell's, to my knowledge, still haven't been released state side. 

Now with the release of the final two shoes, a similar mishap occurred. Only one shoe dropped and the other hasn't and the site is saying the entire line is finished and sold out. Is it commonplace for them to renege on a shoe drop for their own website? (New to the sneaker game)

They didn't have my size so I couldn't try them on, so I'm wondering if they are as comfortable as the boost 4s, and also, if the heel counter is as soft, padded and comfortable as the regular ultraboost. I ask cuz I I have heel bursitis and the reg ultraboost heel doesn't hurt at all .  Any thoughts?  Thanks!

Everything went through just fine, after I ordered the website shows that they no longer have size 11 in stock.  Cool, I figured I got the last pair.  Fast forward to January 9th. My order still hasn't shipped from the warehouse.  I contact support to make sure there is no stocking error.  The rep reassures me that everything is fine and my order will ship soon.  An hour after that chat, I get an email stating my order was cancelled (due to stock error). I decided to check the product on the website and right after they cancelled my order, the inventory went from 0 in stock to 3.  I contacted support again to try and figure out what the hell happened.  The person I spoke to said that sometimes their system takes a while to update, and even though it says they have 3 in stock, that it is probably incorrect. They specifically told me not to order again, because it would just be cancelled.  It didn't make sense that the system would update from 0 in stock to 3 in stock right after cancelling my order.

I decided to take a chance and re place my order since the website was showing 3 available.  I placed my order last night and sure enough, I just got a confirmation email that my size 11 Kamandas just shipped.

September comes around, I was at work the Saturday of the release of Goku, busy as all hell. I get home my wife asks ""did you manage to get a pair of Goku??"", A sudden moment of despair creeped over me, I was so busy at work I had entirely forgot.

Fast forward to the Vegeta drop, I'm at work, again. This time I'm prepared, I make the time to get into the waiting room, finally get through to the order menu, get my order placed, and boom Vegeta on the way. I was happy with just that.

As it turns out my wife has been behind my back, hunting these shoes on eBay as my Christmas present. She was toying with me last week, asking which ones I'd like to have in some sort of hypothetical world. I said Goku, Gohan, or even Cell. I said ""oh my God you got me another pair didn't you??"" She leaves the room and comes back with a size 10 pair of Goku. I was ecstatic!

I am new to the ""shoe business"" and I just wanted to ask a question.

Does someone of you have experience with buying limited shoes? Because I would like to buy the shoes in a few months for a few more bucks on maybe eBay or other platforms, do you think that I will be able to buy NEW shoes in a few months from e.g. maybe people that just buy them to sell them for more or will they be completely unavailable?

9591,What are you people doing?,"The stage 2 dragon Ball z shoes (cell vs Gohan) were announced earlier this month to be released on October 27th. 2-3 days before the release date they move it forward a day so that it will be released on October 26th at 10:00 am. If you move a release date up it is usually expected that the product is all ready to be released and their will be no problems. Not only was this not the case but they moved it back to the original date again. Which is fine whatever things happen. But why remove them from the online store? Why the fuck would you remove a highly valued product from the online store ONLY IN AMERICA BY THE WAY EVERYWHERE ELSE GOT THEM ONLINE. Why the fuck are the pharell shoes that nobody wants on the store but the Dragon ball shoes that will most likely make triple the profit not?

""So what? In store isn't that bad. Just get up and drive there."" Except only stored around in the fucking 15th century will get them. The closest one to me is in fucking New York which is an 8 hour drive. 

The biggest problem to me is the fucking lying that went on through the last 2 days from customer service. Everyone contradicted each other, I called yesterday they said in store only. I called again yesterday and they said online only. I called again today online again and an hour ago I called again and its in store only. How fucking hard is it to send a fucking memo to your customer service representatives? 

Also why the fuck is this stage different? Everyone says this is the best set so why the fuck was the first one online and this one wasn't? The Frieza ones were still in stock a week before these were going to drop because they were so ugly. Why are the best ones (that sold out instantly over seas by the way) not online?

The America branch of this company is a fucking joke. Usually a brand will sacrifice pleasing fans for maximizing profit or vice versa, but no smart person can say that by limiting the releases even more than they already were will make them any more money.

Of course they still do not have it. Postponed again this time I have not been given a reason nor a potential release date. They simply pointed me to their app and told me to sign up for the Creators club for the exclusive updates regarding future releases - the very same app which has no product page for ANY of the DBZ sneakers, including those already released.

**Mikitype Track Jacket | CF1135**

I recently bought this jacket off Grailed for a steal of $75 (before shipping)! The seller said it was barely worn and it's pretty true. It looks practically new without any flaws. It was, of course, also 100% authentic. I haven't really seen this jacket online anywhere and thought the design was really clean and sharp, so I kind of ""impulse"" bought it off Grailed when I saw the price it was listed at.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anichkov Hoodie | BS2196**

I bought this hoodie just yesterday from Burlington for $29.99. I've been seeing a lot of clothing from the Originals line show up at places like Burlington with the original tags still attached, just like mine. I even picked up a pair of EQT 93/17 GTXs from there as well a few months back. As for the actually hoodie, it's pretty big and also pretty thick, which is perfect for the upcoming winter months. The bright red color also makes it stand out too, which is one of the reasons I thought this was a great hoodie. For a price of $30 instead of $80, how could I not've passed on this one either?

My job has me walking a lot. Im a delivery guy for a restaurant, and this has me walking more than you might think. so, im looking for shoes that might be good for someone like me, or a UPS guy, or the mailman, etc.

Question: can I wear runner shoes daily? I mean, i know the shoe SWAT team arent going to pop outta nowhere and arrest me for it, but what I mean is will they hold up better or worse than Campus or similar regular shoes? I remember working for a guy who was into running, and this dude was ordering new shoes constantly, but idk if he was just hard on them, or a shoe junkie or what. do runner shoes just give super comfort, but wear out faster than regular shoes, are they better? or what?

But I never got a confirmation email or receipt in my email.  I tried using their chat help on the site... it doesn't work. I called them yesterday and was on hold for 92 minutes before I gave up.  I called this morning, another 90 mins and then I hung up. This afternoon I waited 60 minutes and still no answer. Just playing music and saying the wait will be longer than 15 minutes. 

Ive checked my ""promotions"" folder and my ""spam"" folder and nothing is in there from Adidas. 

I have sent emails, and everything. Still completely unable to reach anyone to find out if this order happened.  Does anyone have an actual phone number where you can reach a human being? Their phone number that they have on their website 1-800-982-9337 does NOT work at all. They tell you it will take 15 minutes in the recorded message but nobody answers. I had the phone on speaker for 90 minutes... twice!

9802,Yeezy Supply Sent Me the Wrong Size Triple White’s,"Long story short, I ordered my triple white yeezys through the yeezysupply presale on the Thursday before they were set to release. I ordered size 9, as was indicated by the confirmation email that I both screenshotted and saved in my inbox (I wanted some kind of paper trail on the off chance something like this happened). 

When I get the box in the mail I checked to ensure that it said SIZE 9 on the outside and then tried the shoes on. They seemed a bit loose which I found surprising considering the 350’s are supposed to run a half size small and I’m normally a size 9.  Whatever, I just put extra insoles in them, tried them on again, cut off the tags, and put them back in the box. I only wore them on the carpet in my room. 

Flash forward to the following day, (yesterday) I try them on again because I was a bit shaken up by the fact that the $220 shoes I had just bought didn’t fit quite right. Never wore them off the carpet once again. This time, as I’m fidgeting with the insoles I actually look at the size indicated on the interior tag and see that they are in fact SIZE 10. My heart sinks, as you would expect. At this point I wasn’t sure how to react so I just put them back in the box and took a nap to clear my mind. 

What should I do reddit?

I’m thinking I can either try and trade these for a size 9 if someone is offering, or try and get an exchange/refund if yeezysupply will admit to their mistake. I still haven’t contacted customer service for yeezy supply because I wanted some input on this first.

Found my dream shoes, but Adidas has been continually sold out and I couldn't find them anywhere (not even many hits on Google; maybe they're rare?) save for on Poshmark. After weeks of deliberating, I decided to role the die and go for it. They just came and can't tell if I'm creating a mountain out of a molehill with the issues I'm noticing. Researched ""how to spot fakes"" all day and I'm literally 50/50 at this point. Apologies in advance for being such a noob!

Adidas page to actual shoe (best look): adidas.com/us/stan-smith-shoes/G27997.html

The main issues I've noticed are these below, but I can't tell if these differences are just inherent to a professional photoshoot vs. the real thing:

* More snakeskin-like texture on mine
* Color on mine are a tiny bit more pink-looking
* Certain trim appears to be red on mine compared to white on the website
* Some bad stitching in certain spots and small fraying
* Tried scanning barcode with various apps and returned no matching results (but again, these seem rare anyhow)
   * Note that I already checked the ART number against the box (matches perfectly) and that the shoes have serial #'s that differ in the last 3 digits (they do).

This is officially the most supermodel look I've ever seen.

In honor of National Sibling Day, Kim Kardashian shared a photo op of her and Kylie Jenner wearing matching outfits, the likes of which I have never seen before in my life. They're kind of like one-legged bodysuits that are also boots? Or like, over-the-shoulder boots? I'm not really sure what to call these. Either way, fashion has just reached another new (weird) milestone, courtesy of the Kardashian/Jenner fam.

**Tiger Blazer and a Bra**

Bras and blazers, day two! For the second time this week, King Kylie (does she still call herself that?) forgot to put on a shirt before leaving the house. She showed off a black bra at Khloe Kardashian's birthday party and wow, we have truly been blessed.

**Bra and a Blazer**

Sexy blazer looks are becoming a Kardashian/Jenner staple. Kim loves [going topless under the business casual jackets](https://www.seventeen.com/fashion/celeb-fashion/g1746/kim-kardashian-makeover/) and now Kylie's getting in on the trend. She posted a fire Instagram wearing nothing but a lacy bra under a silky maroon blazer. In related news, my smoke alarm is now going off.

**Girly Sweater and Jeans**The queen of Fashion Nova is back with another fire fit for under $100. Kylie's servin bod in a $30 fluff crop top and ass-hugging $35 jeans – both of which are still available online in almost every size. I never thought I'd have a burning desire to own a one-shoulder sweater, but alas, the power of Kylie.

7,Adidas Canada Warranty Nightmare,"I've placed several orders with [adidas.ca](https://adidas.ca) over the past couple of years and was very satisfied.  But my latest experience was horrible!

I ordered a pair of Copa Mundial Cleats for my daughter.  Within a month of use, the toe separated.  I contacted warranty and got an RA#, sent the shoes back and received confirmation from UPS that they had been received on July 30.  After waiting a few weeks, I contacted Adidas at least five times.  I had been told the issue would be prioritized, another told me it would be escalated, another told me she would personally make the warranty department aware of the issue, since it had been about 6 weeks by then that the shoes had been received by adidas.

On September 19 I was told I'd be issued a voucher as a refund.  As of today, October 1, I still had not received ANY emails from adidas about my claim, nor received a voucher.  So I called today and spent about an hour on the phone talking with one person who finally issued me a voucher.  BUT, he also said that it was only good for the purchase of a single item!  This claim had gone on so long that I had to purchase another pair of Mundials for my daughter, since she was going overseas for soccer.  I was planning to use the voucher to purchase a pair of Mundial Team Shoes for myself.and a couple of other items to make up the $200.

The voucher would not even work for the Mundial Team Shoes, as they are excluded from the promo code (voucher).  So I had to call customer service yet again.  After about 20 minutes she was able to allow me to use the voucher for the shoes.  But she also told me that my purchase had to be $200 or more, so I had to add other items to my order.  So I added two more items to make the order over $200.  Well the voucher went through, but it was indeed only for a single item.  It asked me for another $52.50 for the other items.  So I lost $50 ($40 difference in value of the voucher, plus the GST of $10 because the representative who issued the voucher could not issue the voucher for $210, only the purchase price).  I didn't really need the other two items, but I had no way of deleting the extra two items while in the checkout without risking having to start all over again and then probably finding out that my voucher had already been used.

I am 63 years old and in all my life I have never had such a terrible experience with customer service and wasted so much of my time because of a warranty issue!!!",adidas,1569951469,YUKONER777,1,2,True,2019-10-01

The ones that have 3 stripes on the peak (example: https://i.imgur.com/UOQD5om.png ) don't have any stitching on the peak which leads to the underside of the peak having the material stretched tight but coming away from the hard peak so it has a ""spongy"" feel when you press it. The caps I have with plain peaks have stitching on both sides of the peak and don't suffer from this sponginess at all.

So my question is: do Adidas make a baseball cap that has stripes on the peak that is also stitched to avoid this sponginess issue or does the addition of the stripes on the peak mean they can't do the stitching?

1,My feet don’t think boost is comfy.,I’ve recently bought a pair of ultraboost 4.0s and right when I bought them I noticed the boost felt hard and uncomfy. The feeling got better and the boost doesn’t feel so uncomfortable anymore but it still feels somewhat hard. I went to an adidas store in nyc to test the nite joggers and when I walked with them they also didn’t feel squishy or responsive at all. I didn’t get a pair of nite joggers since they didn’t have them in my size. If it changes anything I’m about 100-110 pounds and I’m just a teen.

Now it's July and I have been on the phone with them numerous times trying to get a refund.  I was even issued an email stating it would be deposited within 3-5 business days (obviously this didn't happen).  
I called AGAIN and they told me the payment was being froze but couldn't answer ANYTHING further then this, and there was noone I could talk to about getting my refund.  It was being handled ""overseas"" so there is no number to call or contact.  


So since that drop in March, it has been **MY** responsibility to find the solution to this problem (I guess by nagging them?) or they would have swept it under the rug and I would be out $300 CAD.

I’m used to a loose and separated tongue I guess since the UB’s have a “sock” mold to it, but I really love these shoes and having to take them back because of an annoyance like that would suck.

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell is going on with my order?  I placed an order on 6/25 and it is still processing and your phone support told me that you will probably end up cancelling it.  I am a ""game changer"" which means I have spent a good bit of money with you and apparently that is supposed to have 2nd day shipping.  Why hasn't it been shipped?  Where is my refund?  Aren't I considered to be a valued customer?

I bought Ultraboosts as a gift for my mom since she is elderly and has to stand all day.  She is in a lot of pain and I bought these because they are great shoes and I hoped it would help her.  Unfortunately, she never got them because your shipping is garbage.  These were an expensive gift and all of that money spent is just wasted for the time being.

I am out of options because no one at Adidas wants to help.  I have posted multiple times to your Instagram account about this in hopes that someone would contact me.  Instead I have been blocked and my messages removed.  Adidas has not contacted me yet.

7,"Someone stole my adidas package, adidas will not compensate/assist me","I ordered the Yeezy Boost 700 Vanta V2 along with the Pharrell NMDs around a couple weeks ago. I live in California, but at the time of the online purchase, I was in Seattle for my best friend's graduation. The package was supposedly arriving 2 days before I got back to California, however, I knew that FedEx would not deliver it without a signature and would hold the package at the local post office for an X amount of days, enough time to pick it up when I got back. However, the package says that it was signed and delivered to my address in my name, which was impossible because I wasn't in the state at the time. I contacted adidas and they told me to open a case with FedEx and present them proof that I did not receive the package. I attached flight records, AirBnb records, receipts of purchases I made with my debit card, etc., enough to show that I was not home at the delivery of the package. FedEx denied my claim twice and told me that there is nothing they could do about the package, because they delivered it to the right address. I contacted adidas multiple times after that, and eventually they told me that there was nothing they can do because FedEx denied the claim. I purchased the items on Paypal, so it is impossible to do a chargeback because they don't cover stolen/missing packages. Are there any other steps I can do?

So, i snarked her and told her to check every single other sneaker store in America. However - it seems as if no other stores sell these things?? They sell the 19's but not the uncaged style. Can someone explain to me why this certain style is only on the Adidas site? Or where in the hell I can locate them elsewhere?",adidas,1560794100,a_dot_bram,6,1,True,2019-06-17

Currently, I am able to invest a large amount into a pair of gym shoes to use 5 days a week, but they have to sustain.

3,In love with my new Sobakovs but I need advice on sizing. Does the knit tend to stretch?,"I’m a woman who typically wears a size 8 to 8 1/2 in Adidas. However, I always find myself really liking the men’s models more so I have learned to size down to boys youth size 6 1/2 to 7. I have a recent pair of Tubular Shadows in a 7 and I regret not getting a 6 or 6.5 tbh. When I first bought them and tried them on, they fit pretty well but after some wear it seems like the knit just really loosened up.

Right now I have two pairs of Sobakovs in a 7 and a 6 1/2. The 6 1/2 fit nice and snug with thin invisible socks. The seven could definitely be worn with some thicker socks and otherwise feel pretty good. 

If I keep the 6 1/2 I’m scared that my toes may deform the shoe if I end up putting extra pressure on the balls of my feet, but they are in no way “small“. On the other hand, I’m scared that if I keep the size 7, they will end up like my Tubulars that just feel hella loose after some wear.


For anyone who has these shoes, have you noticed any extra stretching? I googled a bunch but there aren’t very many concrete answers except for the fact that the sizing of this model is a little bit confusing and many people have had to even size down one entire size.

I’m trying to not overthink this too much but because of my previous experience, I really don’t want to make the wrong choice since the triple blacks were harder to track down than I expected. 

Any advice is appreciated thanks in advance!",adidas,1560620335,L3aBoB3a,0,1,True,2019-06-15

5,Does Boost have any negative effect on the body?,"I've been wearing Boost for sometime, before it was Puma's NRGZ, since both are pretty much similar tech, i had to roll back to non-boost shoe as the Boost is waiting to be dried. I noticed that on the non-boost shoe my feet feels fatigue after a while, and after a whole day of walk awaken in the middle of the night i felt some mild back pain.

Before wearing NRGZ/Boost, i've always have tired feet but it never felt that tired, just tired, and i never had back pain, while everything felt better with Boost, i'm wondering if the softer cushion actually weakens some parts of the body so when you revert back to non-boost shoes your body cannot take it as much as before?

I'm sure you can say it's like comparing a cheap chair with a good chair, you won't go back to the cheap chair and the moment you do you felt the big difference, going back to non-boost i can clearly tell the difference but i can also remember i did not felt that bad last time. it's only less than 2 years since i wore foam type shoes. Even on flip flops for a short walk i can feel my feet are tired.

I'm just worried with the Boost, it somehow makes certain part of the body weak, similar to wearing ankle braces, while it helps reduce injury it also weakens the ankles if wore on daily basis.",adidas,1560486034,burningbun,11,2,True,2019-06-14

I have a favorite pair of black and white Adidas track pants.  They are flared and there is no ankle zipper.

I'm looking for a kind of Samba/Kaiser 5 hybrid, I bought these shoes around 2007/8 in Germany.

It doesn't have any kind of golden letters near the stripes or suede at the tip like the Sambas.

I threw them away cause they were pretty broken after 12 years of sports and wearing them eyery day and bought Sambas because I couldn't find them anwhere (I wouldn't wonder if they actually don't have a name). Sambas are great, but I don't like them as much as my old ones.

That's not good at all for me, I was hoping it'd be at least an inch or less, but it wasn't even that. So I decided to exchange it. Exchanged for an 8.5, hasn't arrived yet, but I hope it fits just right. I was wondering, just how many inches/centimeters of space should I have between my toe and the end of the shoe?

They  are laced, like the R1, but don't have any rigid eyelets, instead the  laces weave through holes punched directly through the mesh. They have  black &amp; white snakeskin patterned mesh and the orange vertical  stripes in the same place as both below. They do NOT have the ankle  elastic running to the midsoles like the CS2, simply connecting around  the top like the R1. All other differences are shown below.

I would attach an image of my own pair, but they are filthy and have been well loved, but not cared for properly.

Any help would be appreciated, as I've been looking and looking with no luck.

I now have the [Alphabounce Beyond M's](https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Alphabounce-Beyond-Shoes-AW18/dp/B07HC19HKT)  but I am running in a few issues with them, I have worn them for a couple months now and I feel like they've bottomed out a bit but that's not so bad as the fact that whenever I do a step I feel like my foot is going off the sole a bit and too much into the PK - It's not awful but I feel like it doesn't give me enough support and that might be because of the (lack of) cage?   


An other issue is the fact that if I go for longer than 15K in them, they aren't comfortable anymore and I get some sore feet afterwards, it's not so bad but it is also not really uncommon for me to go over 15 kilometers a day  


Tl;dr: What do you suggest me to buy for long walks (15K+) that offers great support and is on the rigid side when it comes to the upper - Thanks",adidas,1555345653,valentine1999,5,2,True,2019-04-15

4,Need help replacing my favorite Nike Hoodie,"I need help replacing my favorite Nike hoodie. It is a Nike Hero Elite Full-zip that is purple and grey. I bought it when I was a teen, but the medium doesn’t fit anymore. I am now an XL size. 

I would prefer a replacement that is dark purple, gray, or black. Purple is my favorite color, but I need something that I could wear to work as well.

I’ve seen products on the Nike website that I liked, but I really liked the thumb holes on the hoodie that I have and didn’t see any like that on the Nike website. It has a separate part that is not part of the cuff that covers the hand. I would really like to have something like this again. 

I would prefer a full zip again, but would also buy a pullover or quarter zip that looked nice and had the thumb holes that I like.

I have varpomax plus' and my right big toe hurts when i have them on. Its not because there is not enough room in the front (about 1 thumb), its because the shoe just presses on my toes so it hurts.

What should i do? Return them and get 1 size bigger (sadly i cant go half a size up because between 41 and 42 EU there isnt a 41,5) or just keep wearing them so they give in? Anyone with vapormax's that can tell me what to do?

I heard people say that you should go for 1 size bigger with vapormax's anyway but im not sure about that because that will result in me having about 1 and a half up thumb space empty in the front.

Has anyone tried the newest models of the shoe- or similar models? Do any of them feel ""minimal"" or anything like the older versions? 

And bonus points if you can point me toward other popular shoe brands that have good minimal ""running"" shoes. Most of the adidas shoes I've tried (as nice as they look) are way to cushion-y. 

These shoes aren't for running purposes- just something stylish/athletic with minimal cushioning and well built. 

With the 2016-2017 free runs.

iirc hey look like high top Air Jordan 1.  
Color mostly white and secondary color black. The specialty is that the Nike logo is made of a material that breaks the light up into its natural colors. So it wasn't a single color, but a bit of green, yellow, reddish tint etc.

14,Nike Returns Policy,"Now the new football (soccer) season has now started I wanted to get a new pair of boots but £200+ is a fee I'd rather not pay. Then i came across the returns policy:
&gt; We design our shoes and gear to help you perform at peak level, so if they're not working exactly right for you, we've got you covered. When you buy on Nike.com, we provide you 30 days from the delivery date to take your Nike or Hurley purchases for a trial run, confidently knowing you can return (or exchange) any item (some exceptions apply) for any reason within 30 days. That even includes custom Nike By You sneakers. No questions asked and no delivery costs for NikePlus Members. And after 30 days, you can still return items if they're unworn and unwashed.

So go ahead, shop with confidence and enjoy your 30-day, risk-free trial.

From my understanding this means that I can buy a pair of boots, train and play in them for 25ish days, return them (most likely not in a resellable condition), receive my refund and buy another new pair, then rinse and repeat for the whole season.

I had a chat with a friend today who said that one of his friends did this last season so he basically had a new pair of boots every month and Nike never stopped him. At face value this would suggest I'm fine to do the same and have new boots each month and return them at the end of that month but I find it hard to believe that Nike won't suspend me from returning items if I continue to buy and return the same item (potentially different CW but still) each month. If I think about it from their perspective, they have no reason not to stop me from doing this; it's not like they're going to lose a customer if they do so, and I'm pushing my luck by doing this so I can't really angry if they do lol.

If you've exploited their returns policy like this or in a similar way please reply with your experiences, whether you've been banned/suspended or warned by Nike or never had an issue, I'm very interested to hear if anyone else has done this. Cheers",Nike,1568843997,owxnw14,2,0,True,2019-09-18

5,Nike.com gift card ridiculous policies!,"Last year in November I received 2 gift card of $500 HKD from my wife.   I figured it's September now it's time to use it before it expires.  
 

What happened was the shittiest online ordering experience ever.

First, apparently I can't use 2 gift cards at once in the same order.  If I buy a pair of shoes for $1200 I can only use 1 card.  Which means I have to pay $700 to get the pair of shoes I want, and find another $500 worth of product to finish up the last card.

Secondly, I input the gift card information and decided to not place the order at the checkout (ie refresh the page because I couldn't find an option to use 2 cards at once), the next time I entered the card info, it displays I have $0.00 left on the card balance.  Naturally I called customer service and I was told once I input the card information, their system will hold my money for 24 hours regardless I place the order or not.   

When I asked your customer service over the phone what happens when the gift card expires while my fund is being held, she just said unfortunately the fund will be lost.

Someone please verify with me on these information, I would like to know for sure if I was just misinformed by an lazy customer service representative.  Otherwise, this has to be the crappiest gift card system I've ever seen from a large company.",Nike,1568532065,danhoyuen,6,4,True,2019-09-15

They could be a bit heavy sometimes, but they felt great on my feet and helped maximize my play. Kyrie 5's on the other hand, a bit disappointed with.

So I was in the hunt for some Romaleos 3 XD for gym but I realised how much of dedicated lifting shoe they are that the sales person turned me to the Metcon 5's. I do a lot more than lifts in the gym and while not a dedicated lifting shoe, thought it would me the versatility I need.

So I bought them retail. US 9, the same as every single other pair of Nike shoes I own. I tried thick and thin socks and got mad heel slip. The forefoot of the shoe felt perfect but the heel slipped on every single stride.

Went back to the store and modified the lacing pattern a bit which helped, but damn son, it was still there. They didn't have 8.5's but I tried 8's on kicks and the heel slip stopped so I'm putting this down to sizing.

It's so odd. I've never had this before on any nike shoes. I know that the heel line is a bit lower on Metcons, never owned them before, but I couldn't wear them to the gym with what I was getting. The hyperlift insert made it slightly worse.

0,Are they too small or is it okay?,"Hi there! 

So I purchased some Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe in a size 7 (typically my size) when they were on sale last week, online. I've been saving up to buy a nice sneaker because I am on my feet a lot and have a big trip coming up.  I usually buy whatever the cheapest costco sneaker is and it's been perfectly fine till now.

I thought I'd splurge a little on a basic Nike sneaker.  I think I got the pair for $60~.  

My only concern is I got them in and I've been walking around in them and it does seem like they might be too small.  It actually fits REALLY WELL everywhere except the tip of my toe.  I'm a bit surprised how awesome everything else feels.  I thought there was a little room left but as I am walking in them through the day, my toe nails have gotten kinda achey.  

I think the sale is over so I was wondering if you guys think it'd be okay if they ""break in""?  Will they stretch out a little you guys think?  

I don't think the Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe comes in a 7.5...but I actually can't find this shoe on the website anymore (i might be blind).  

I'm in a weird time in my life right now so I can't really afford anything better so it would be great if maybe these would stretch out a bit.  I'm being very careful with my money right now.

Any suggestions of another style would be great!  Basically looking for the most budget shoe Nike offers (really impressed by the cushion on this pair) that will help my feet walking around for 8-9 hours a day.  I can spend upwards of $80 but it's a bit of a stretch for me, so that's why I was so happy to catch the Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe on sale last week.

*  We want to be 100% transparent with you all, this isn't a get rich quick scheme, but we need to fix the current status of legit checks
*  A free check on Reddit or Facebook can take hours to days sometimes going unanswered, and when you check the comments, it's flooded with random users you can't trust arguing over fake and real comments, this achieves nothing and makes the prospective buyer more anxious about the purchase.
* We are here to offer consistent and quality checks, with a definitive answer. You'll get the opinions of 3 LCers working together to help you.
* When checks are free, there is no drive to keep quality or speed up. There needs to be an incentive for legit checkers to stay motivated to want to do checks.
*  Each check costs 5$, we have 3 of our trained legit checkers discuss and pick each others brains before collectively deciding on the outcome
*  Each legit checker is paid 1$ per check, the remaining 2$ are split between maintaining the store, building the community, and creating more resources to keep our legit checkers up to par for every new shoe, and the staff who works on other aspects of the community.

* wanted to buy new shoes, sounds easy and nike even makes an app for that.
* ordered custom shoes and order gets canceled for unknown reasons
* try to reorder shoes with a customer service rep and give my CC over the phone and i was told i cannot buy the shoe i wanted because the custom shoes i wanted are no longer available. (thats right fokes, * * you think you are making custom shoes but in reality they just make a bunch of different colors and dont release them until ordered) this also means they run out and you cannot get them anymore.
* select a different shoe order them and still my order gets canceled (OMG are you serious)
* i reorder after creating a new account and guess what the shoes are not available.
* i talk to customer service and they give me 2 promo codes (20% off and free next day shipping)i was explicitly told to use the promo codes together.
* i pick out new shoes and go to use the promo codes and i am not able to use both together (@at this point i am buying 6 pairs of off the shelf shoes and 3 customs)
* i call customer service and they say a manager will call me back in 2 hours
* i wait and guess what one of my shoes that are custom made are no longer available
* i call back and i was told the same thing give them an hour or so to get free and a manager will address all my issues
* i wait again ( lost another shoe) ugh .. .
* i get irritated with waiting and end up with using one 1 promo code
* i call back and get another rep that tells me well if they cancel the order they can apply both promo codes ( i declined because i am not loosing the last custom shoe i made)
* i was told they will have a manager call me back with in an hour
* next day told the same thing
* i contacted support 9 times over the course of the day, never once getting to a manager and now i am being told that i will not receive a call back until 1-2 days of business and they never guarantee that it will be a call or within an hour.

**** i am just done..... *****
after all of this and still get no customer service
there is a 90% chance that they will end up getting there shoes back and i will just go to ADIDAS

note: here is one of the several chat transcription guaranteeing a call or email back:
customer service Rep: Thanks! There is no available manager as of the moment but no worries, I will escalate this concern to our Elite Team and we will call/email you within 2-4 hours.

Sadly, I can't really find them in my size anywhere anymore, so now I'm looking for a shoe that basically has the same fit as these ones, from a current collection. Specifically, the soft heel. Most Nike shoes I've had have a sort of plastic support in the heel which always ends up breaking and sawing into my Achilles tendon, and the Stefan Janoski ones with their soft, unsupported heel don't. If anyone knows of a current shoe with such a heel (and preferably the same kind of blue, though that's more of a 'nice to have') it would be greatly appreciated. Considering different markets and whatnot, I should probably mention I'm from the Netherlands. Thanks in advance!

3,Nike we got a problem here,"This is a problem with Nike’s uniforms in college and professional sports. Now before you start mentioning anything, no this is not going to be a political post. And I’m not trying to troll, I’m trying to provide suggestions for anyone who might know Nike dealers or anyone who makes uniforms with Nike.

But Nike, what is your deal with screwing up uniforms in both college and professional sports?

There are very few circumstances that a new designed Nike uniform in sports looks good. Take Clemson’s retro football uniform as one of the few examples.

What’s the exact problem with Nike? Let’s start out with

1. Coloring
Nike you have a problem with dark colors. What’s wrong with royal blue man? How about orange, or maybe powder blue? Take Ole Miss’ college football uniforms (I’m not an ole miss fan), they’re fine but they’d look so much better if they weren’t navy blue. So many teams have navy blue, it’s the least original color there is. And take the Miami Dolphins jersey before the touchup. Why would you include like a dark blue lining there? What was the point? Why did you get rid of the orange? And with the lakers, why did you change the color to banana yellow? Do us a favor, and stick with the colors that are already provided. Don’t change them, don’t add anything new, stick with the old colors.

2. Trying to incorporate their own design
Look I get that you want to make teams unique, like Syracuse with gradients, or the seahawks with that weird helmet design, but what people prefer is simpler classic looking jerseys. How many people do you see complaining about the cowboys uniforms, the crimson tide, or the Celtics classic greens? Every year, the lowest ranked jerseys in college football, professional football, and professional basketball are the ones that have too much going on or trying to incorporate their own “new” look.

And probably the most important one
3. What’s your problem with block style numbers?

Seriously did a kid wearing a block style jersey bite your balls off as a kid? There’s nothing wrong with keeping the numbers in the standard football font. Every now and then a different font looks good on a particular jersey (IE Bears, Steelers maybe), but 99% of the fonts Nike creates to add flair look very shit.

I don’t want to rat on Syracuse again but their old uniforms in college football had the most disgusting number font. You’ve made LSU’s font look like it was put through a taffy puller. You make the Dolphins numbers look like a malnourished child. You made the seminoles numbers look like they could rip my finger off just touching a jersey. 

Block style numbers aren’t bad, simplicity and the classic “football” looking uniforms are what people prefer. Pitt’s and Syracuse’s new uniforms this season are a step in the right direction, and even the Detroit Lions look alright, but you fucked with the numbers again on all 3. Please stop with that shit. 

Nike, just keep the classic colors, don’t try to add some “unique” flair to a uniform that doesn’t need it, and stay away from any number font that’s not a form of block style
