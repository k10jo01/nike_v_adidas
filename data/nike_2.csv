iirc hey look like high top Air Jordan 1.  
Color mostly white and secondary color black. The specialty is that the Nike logo is made of a material that breaks the light up into its natural colors. So it wasn't a single color, but a bit of green, yellow, reddish tint etc.   
There's also a name for that ""feature"" I can't remember. I think it started with c, was 5 to 7 letters long and I think it looked like a French word.

So I came across this sale on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01I50U4L6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) \- the seller looked legit and in terms of fake products, Amazon seems to be very strict (at least over here in Germany) and it is very hard to get your hands on fake products in general. So I bought the pant, but when it arrived I was kinda surprised, there are many differences when I compared it to my ""legit"" jogger. I contacted the seller and they said that the pant is 100% legit, they sold hundreds of these and they get their products directly from Nike. 

Overall the quality is so much lower, the fabric is so much lighter, the zipper is different, the tags, the Swoosh is kinda off...

49,Nike.com gift card ridiculous policies!,"Last year in November I received 2 gift card of $500 HKD from my wife.   I figured it's September now it's time to use it before it expires.  
 

What happened was the shittiest online ordering experience ever.

First, apparently I can't use 2 gift cards at once in the same order.  If I buy a pair of shoes for $1200 I can only use 1 card.  Which means I have to pay $700 to get the pair of shoes I want, and find another $500 worth of product to finish up the last card.

Secondly, I input the gift card information and decided to not place the order at the checkout (ie refresh the page because I couldn't find an option to use 2 cards at once), the next time I entered the card info, it displays I have $0.00 left on the card balance.  Naturally I called customer service and I was told once I input the card information, their system will hold my money for 24 hours regardless I place the order or not.   

When I asked your customer service over the phone what happens when the gift card expires while my fund is being held, she just said unfortunately the fund will be lost.

Someone please verify with me on these information, I would like to know for sure if I was just misinformed by an lazy customer service representative.  Otherwise, this has to be the crappiest gift card system I've ever seen from a large company.",Nike,1568532065,danhoyuen,6,4,True,2019-09-15

103,Nike Returns Policy,"Now the new football (soccer) season has now started I wanted to get a new pair of boots but £200+ is a fee I'd rather not pay. Then i came across the returns policy:
&gt; We design our shoes and gear to help you perform at peak level, so if they're not working exactly right for you, we've got you covered. When you buy on Nike.com, we provide you 30 days from the delivery date to take your Nike or Hurley purchases for a trial run, confidently knowing you can return (or exchange) any item (some exceptions apply) for any reason within 30 days. That even includes custom Nike By You sneakers. No questions asked and no delivery costs for NikePlus Members. And after 30 days, you can still return items if they're unworn and unwashed.

So go ahead, shop with confidence and enjoy your 30-day, risk-free trial.

From my understanding this means that I can buy a pair of boots, train and play in them for 25ish days, return them (most likely not in a resellable condition), receive my refund and buy another new pair, then rinse and repeat for the whole season.

I had a chat with a friend today who said that one of his friends did this last season so he basically had a new pair of boots every month and Nike never stopped him. At face value this would suggest I'm fine to do the same and have new boots each month and return them at the end of that month but I find it hard to believe that Nike won't suspend me from returning items if I continue to buy and return the same item (potentially different CW but still) each month. If I think about it from their perspective, they have no reason not to stop me from doing this; it's not like they're going to lose a customer if they do so, and I'm pushing my luck by doing this so I can't really angry if they do lol.

If you've exploited their returns policy like this or in a similar way please reply with your experiences, whether you've been banned/suspended or warned by Nike or never had an issue, I'm very interested to hear if anyone else has done this. Cheers",Nike,1568843997,owxnw14,2,0,True,2019-09-18

So I decided to take them back to my local footlocker and get a new pair replacing the squeaking ones. The clerk told me that this has never happened before and that he would return them as “damaged.” I thanked him and got a replacement pair for free. Today I wore that pair to work, (I work a desk job and walk around a mile or two in total all day.) And believe it or not the right foot started to squeak exactly like the other pair. I can’t find anything on google about this issue so I came here.

54,Nike has the worse customer service - DON'T BUY-,"long story short:

* wanted to buy new shoes, sounds easy and nike even makes an app for that.
* ordered custom shoes and order gets canceled for unknown reasons
* try to reorder shoes with a customer service rep and give my CC over the phone and i was told i cannot buy the shoe i wanted because the custom shoes i wanted are no longer available. (thats right fokes, * * you think you are making custom shoes but in reality they just make a bunch of different colors and dont release them until ordered) this also means they run out and you cannot get them anymore.
* select a different shoe order them and still my order gets canceled (OMG are you serious)
* i reorder after creating a new account and guess what the shoes are not available.
* i talk to customer service and they give me 2 promo codes (20% off and free next day shipping)i was explicitly told to use the promo codes together.
* i pick out new shoes and go to use the promo codes and i am not able to use both together (@at this point i am buying 6 pairs of off the shelf shoes and 3 customs)
* i call customer service and they say a manager will call me back in 2 hours
* i wait and guess what one of my shoes that are custom made are no longer available
* i call back and i was told the same thing give them an hour or so to get free and a manager will address all my issues
* i wait again ( lost another shoe) ugh .. .
* i get irritated with waiting and end up with using one 1 promo code
* i call back and get another rep that tells me well if they cancel the order they can apply both promo codes ( i declined because i am not loosing the last custom shoe i made)
* i was told they will have a manager call me back with in an hour
* next day told the same thing
* i contacted support 9 times over the course of the day, never once getting to a manager and now i am being told that i will not receive a call back until 1-2 days of business and they never guarantee that it will be a call or within an hour.

**** i am just done..... *****
after all of this and still get no customer service
there is a 90% chance that they will end up getting there shoes back and i will just go to ADIDAS

note: here is one of the several chat transcription guaranteeing a call or email back:
customer service Rep: Thanks! There is no available manager as of the moment but no worries, I will escalate this concern to our Elite Team and we will call/email you within 2-4 hours.

*  We want to be 100% transparent with you all, this isn't a get rich quick scheme, but we need to fix the current status of legit checks
*  A free check on Reddit or Facebook can take hours to days sometimes going unanswered, and when you check the comments, it's flooded with random users you can't trust arguing over fake and real comments, this achieves nothing and makes the prospective buyer more anxious about the purchase.
* We are here to offer consistent and quality checks, with a definitive answer. You'll get the opinions of 3 LCers working together to help you.
* When checks are free, there is no drive to keep quality or speed up. There needs to be an incentive for legit checkers to stay motivated to want to do checks.
*  Each check costs 5$, we have 3 of our trained legit checkers discuss and pick each others brains before collectively deciding on the outcome
*  Each legit checker is paid 1$ per check, the remaining 2$ are split between maintaining the store, building the community, and creating more resources to keep our legit checkers up to par for every new shoe, and the staff who works on other aspects of the community. 
*  We offer an extremely simple to use user interface, operating on Discord allows much greater ease of use while on any device.

213,Are they too small or is it okay?,"Hi there! 

So I purchased some Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe in a size 7 (typically my size) when they were on sale last week, online. I've been saving up to buy a nice sneaker because I am on my feet a lot and have a big trip coming up.  I usually buy whatever the cheapest costco sneaker is and it's been perfectly fine till now.

I thought I'd splurge a little on a basic Nike sneaker.  I think I got the pair for $60~.  

My only concern is I got them in and I've been walking around in them and it does seem like they might be too small.  It actually fits REALLY WELL everywhere except the tip of my toe.  I'm a bit surprised how awesome everything else feels.  I thought there was a little room left but as I am walking in them through the day, my toe nails have gotten kinda achey.  

I think the sale is over so I was wondering if you guys think it'd be okay if they ""break in""?  Will they stretch out a little you guys think?  

I don't think the Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe comes in a 7.5...but I actually can't find this shoe on the website anymore (i might be blind).  

I'm in a weird time in my life right now so I can't really afford anything better so it would be great if maybe these would stretch out a bit.  I'm being very careful with my money right now.

Any suggestions of another style would be great!  Basically looking for the most budget shoe Nike offers (really impressed by the cushion on this pair) that will help my feet walking around for 8-9 hours a day.  I can spend upwards of $80 but it's a bit of a stretch for me, so that's why I was so happy to catch the Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe on sale last week.

239,Heel Slip on Metcon 5 X. What do,"Hi guys. So I was in the hunt for some Romaleos 3 XD for gym but I realised how much of dedicated lifting shoe they are that the sales person turned me to the Metcon 5's. I do a lot more than lifts in the gym and while not a dedicated lifting shoe, thought it would me the versatility I need.

So I bought them retail. US 9, the same as every single other pair of Nike shoes I own. I tried thick and thin socks and got mad heel slip. The forefoot of the shoe felt perfect but the heel slipped on every single stride.

Went back to the store and modified the lacing pattern a bit which helped, but damn son, it was still there. They didn't have 8.5's but I tried 8's on kicks and the heel slip stopped so I'm putting this down to sizing.

It's so odd. I've never had this before on any nike shoes. I know that the heel line is a bit lower on Metcons, never owned them before, but I couldn't wear them to the gym with what I was getting. The hyperlift insert made it slightly worse.

98,Nike we got a problem here,"This is a problem with Nike’s uniforms in college and professional sports. Now before you start mentioning anything, no this is not going to be a political post. And I’m not trying to troll, I’m trying to provide suggestions for anyone who might know Nike dealers or anyone who makes uniforms with Nike.

But Nike, what is your deal with screwing up uniforms in both college and professional sports?

There are very few circumstances that a new designed Nike uniform in sports looks good. Take Clemson’s retro football uniform as one of the few examples.

What’s the exact problem with Nike? Let’s start out with

1. Coloring
Nike you have a problem with dark colors. What’s wrong with royal blue man? How about orange, or maybe powder blue? Take Ole Miss’ college football uniforms (I’m not an ole miss fan), they’re fine but they’d look so much better if they weren’t navy blue. So many teams have navy blue, it’s the least original color there is. And take the Miami Dolphins jersey before the touchup. Why would you include like a dark blue lining there? What was the point? Why did you get rid of the orange? And with the lakers, why did you change the color to banana yellow? Do us a favor, and stick with the colors that are already provided. Don’t change them, don’t add anything new, stick with the old colors.

2. Trying to incorporate their own design
Look I get that you want to make teams unique, like Syracuse with gradients, or the seahawks with that weird helmet design, but what people prefer is simpler classic looking jerseys. How many people do you see complaining about the cowboys uniforms, the crimson tide, or the Celtics classic greens? Every year, the lowest ranked jerseys in college football, professional football, and professional basketball are the ones that have too much going on or trying to incorporate their own “new” look.

And probably the most important one
3. What’s your problem with block style numbers?

Seriously did a kid wearing a block style jersey bite your balls off as a kid? There’s nothing wrong with keeping the numbers in the standard football font. Every now and then a different font looks good on a particular jersey (IE Bears, Steelers maybe), but 99% of the fonts Nike creates to add flair look very shit.

I don’t want to rat on Syracuse again but their old uniforms in college football had the most disgusting number font. You’ve made LSU’s font look like it was put through a taffy puller. You make the Dolphins numbers look like a malnourished child. You made the seminoles numbers look like they could rip my finger off just touching a jersey. 

Block style numbers aren’t bad, simplicity and the classic “football” looking uniforms are what people prefer. Pitt’s and Syracuse’s new uniforms this season are a step in the right direction, and even the Detroit Lions look alright, but you fucked with the numbers again on all 3. Please stop with that shit. 

Nike, just keep the classic colors, don’t try to add some “unique” flair to a uniform that doesn’t need it, and stay away from any number font that’s not a form of block style

Last week there was a 20% off all clearance items sale that I got a pair of Epic React's from. I thought it was a nice deal, right? Already marked down, and then 20% less!

But now I go back to the clearance page a day after the sale's over (I got my days wrong thinking there was a day left) and all the shoes I had been browsing during the sale week just has a permanent 20% price reduction across the board.

So there was never a 20% off sale, it was just pure marketing. Hell, factoring in when taxes are added it'd be *slightly* cheaper to buy the shoes now then it was last week.",Nike,1561599074,MyManD,1,1,True,2019-06-26

70,Nike ruined another classic: Air Max Uptempo 95 Pippen WHITE/RED/BLACK,"To my knowledge, these colors have never been retroed, since the OG in 95. Only the white/navy and white/black/turquoise. I've been waiting over two decades for the white/red, so when I heard Nike was retroing them, I was very excited. Unfortunately, they changed the classic silhouette. 

The black overlay now extends all the way to the front lace loop, which makes it look more like a Cortez now. Also not feeling the cheap red pleather swoosh.

Could it be too weak and rip very easily? I don’t doubt Nike in their design but it honestly looks like it is going to rip if you pull it a bit harder when putting them on. Let alone run every day. 

I had the 2017 model for 2 years and they were very durable. It makes some sense that 5.0 should be even more durable.

I wore these shoes for 2 years. Basically every day trough 30 degree celsius heat and minus 20 cold. These were my go to sneakers or shoes whatever y'all call them. I have no idea what they were called and now that they are gone for a few months I only now appreciate just how frikkin much I loved them. HELP PLEASE! Give me a name of what these could be called. I found some shoes that have aspects similar, but I need this EXACT pair my size like I had it. I loved it. I would buy 5 pairs of it now for the next 10 years to wear. :( (Also take better care of them).

I added a really shitty paint compilation of my legs with those shoes on. I hope it helps. You are my only hope Sneaker Wan Kenobi. When I won't be this poor anymore, I will definitely reward the kind soul who knows the model of this shoe.
