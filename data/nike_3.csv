161,Nike.com gift card ridiculous policies!,"Last year in November I received 2 gift card of $500 HKD from my wife.   I figured it's September now it's time to use it before it expires.  
 

What happened was the shittiest online ordering experience ever.

First, apparently I can't use 2 gift cards at once in the same order.  If I buy a pair of shoes for $1200 I can only use 1 card.  Which means I have to pay $700 to get the pair of shoes I want, and find another $500 worth of product to finish up the last card.

Secondly, I input the gift card information and decided to not place the order at the checkout (ie refresh the page because I couldn't find an option to use 2 cards at once), the next time I entered the card info, it displays I have $0.00 left on the card balance.  Naturally I called customer service and I was told once I input the card information, their system will hold my money for 24 hours regardless I place the order or not.   

When I asked your customer service over the phone what happens when the gift card expires while my fund is being held, she just said unfortunately the fund will be lost.

Someone please verify with me on these information, I would like to know for sure if I was just misinformed by an lazy customer service representative.  Otherwise, this has to be the crappiest gift card system I've ever seen from a large company.",Nike,1568532065,danhoyuen,6,4,True,2019-09-15

215,Nike Returns Policy,"Now the new football (soccer) season has now started I wanted to get a new pair of boots but £200+ is a fee I'd rather not pay. Then i came across the returns policy:
&gt; We design our shoes and gear to help you perform at peak level, so if they're not working exactly right for you, we've got you covered. When you buy on Nike.com, we provide you 30 days from the delivery date to take your Nike or Hurley purchases for a trial run, confidently knowing you can return (or exchange) any item (some exceptions apply) for any reason within 30 days. That even includes custom Nike By You sneakers. No questions asked and no delivery costs for NikePlus Members. And after 30 days, you can still return items if they're unworn and unwashed.

So go ahead, shop with confidence and enjoy your 30-day, risk-free trial.

From my understanding this means that I can buy a pair of boots, train and play in them for 25ish days, return them (most likely not in a resellable condition), receive my refund and buy another new pair, then rinse and repeat for the whole season.

I had a chat with a friend today who said that one of his friends did this last season so he basically had a new pair of boots every month and Nike never stopped him. At face value this would suggest I'm fine to do the same and have new boots each month and return them at the end of that month but I find it hard to believe that Nike won't suspend me from returning items if I continue to buy and return the same item (potentially different CW but still) each month. If I think about it from their perspective, they have no reason not to stop me from doing this; it's not like they're going to lose a customer if they do so, and I'm pushing my luck by doing this so I can't really angry if they do lol.

If you've exploited their returns policy like this or in a similar way please reply with your experiences, whether you've been banned/suspended or warned by Nike or never had an issue, I'm very interested to hear if anyone else has done this. Cheers",Nike,1568843997,owxnw14,2,0,True,2019-09-18

So I bought the pant, but when it arrived I was kinda surprised, there are many differences when I compared it to my ""legit"" jogger. I contacted the seller and they said that the pant is 100% legit, they sold hundreds of these and they get their products directly from Nike. 

Overall the quality is so much lower, the fabric is so much lighter, the zipper is different, the tags, the Swoosh is kinda off...

353,Nike has the worse customer service - DON'T BUY-,"long story short:

* wanted to buy new shoes, sounds easy and nike even makes an app for that.
* ordered custom shoes and order gets canceled for unknown reasons
* try to reorder shoes with a customer service rep and give my CC over the phone and i was told i cannot buy the shoe i wanted because the custom shoes i wanted are no longer available. (thats right fokes, * * you think you are making custom shoes but in reality they just make a bunch of different colors and dont release them until ordered) this also means they run out and you cannot get them anymore.
* select a different shoe order them and still my order gets canceled (OMG are you serious)
* i reorder after creating a new account and guess what the shoes are not available.
* i talk to customer service and they give me 2 promo codes (20% off and free next day shipping)i was explicitly told to use the promo codes together.
* i pick out new shoes and go to use the promo codes and i am not able to use both together (@at this point i am buying 6 pairs of off the shelf shoes and 3 customs)
* i call customer service and they say a manager will call me back in 2 hours
* i wait and guess what one of my shoes that are custom made are no longer available
* i call back and i was told the same thing give them an hour or so to get free and a manager will address all my issues
* i wait again ( lost another shoe) ugh .. .
* i get irritated with waiting and end up with using one 1 promo code
* i call back and get another rep that tells me well if they cancel the order they can apply both promo codes ( i declined because i am not loosing the last custom shoe i made)
* i was told they will have a manager call me back with in an hour
* next day told the same thing
* i contacted support 9 times over the course of the day, never once getting to a manager and now i am being told that i will not receive a call back until 1-2 days of business and they never guarantee that it will be a call or within an hour.

**** i am just done..... *****
after all of this and still get no customer service
there is a 90% chance that they will end up getting there shoes back and i will just go to ADIDAS

note: here is one of the several chat transcription guaranteeing a call or email back:
customer service Rep: Thanks! There is no available manager as of the moment but no worries, I will escalate this concern to our Elite Team and we will call/email you within 2-4 hours.

*  We want to be 100% transparent with you all, this isn't a get rich quick scheme, but we need to fix the current status of legit checks
*  A free check on Reddit or Facebook can take hours to days sometimes going unanswered, and when you check the comments, it's flooded with random users you can't trust arguing over fake and real comments, this achieves nothing and makes the prospective buyer more anxious about the purchase.
* We are here to offer consistent and quality checks, with a definitive answer. You'll get the opinions of 3 LCers working together to help you.
* When checks are free, there is no drive to keep quality or speed up. There needs to be an incentive for legit checkers to stay motivated to want to do checks.
*  Each check costs 5$, we have 3 of our trained legit checkers discuss and pick each others brains before collectively deciding on the outcome
*  Each legit checker is paid 1$ per check, the remaining 2$ are split between maintaining the store, building the community, and creating more resources to keep our legit checkers up to par for every new shoe, and the staff who works on other aspects of the community.

Could it be too weak and rip very easily? I don’t doubt Nike in their design but it honestly looks like it is going to rip if you pull it a bit harder when putting them on. Let alone run every day. 

I had the 2017 model for 2 years and they were very durable. It makes some sense that 5.0 should be even more durable.

Or any sites where I can find Jordans on discounted prices that aren't scams? I'm always about the deals, so I figure I'd at least ask before I head to champs tomorrow and pick my new shoes up.

428,Nike we got a problem here,"This is a problem with Nike’s uniforms in college and professional sports. Now before you start mentioning anything, no this is not going to be a political post. And I’m not trying to troll, I’m trying to provide suggestions for anyone who might know Nike dealers or anyone who makes uniforms with Nike.

But Nike, what is your deal with screwing up uniforms in both college and professional sports?

There are very few circumstances that a new designed Nike uniform in sports looks good. Take Clemson’s retro football uniform as one of the few examples.

What’s the exact problem with Nike? Let’s start out with

1. Coloring
Nike you have a problem with dark colors. What’s wrong with royal blue man? How about orange, or maybe powder blue? Take Ole Miss’ college football uniforms (I’m not an ole miss fan), they’re fine but they’d look so much better if they weren’t navy blue. So many teams have navy blue, it’s the least original color there is. And take the Miami Dolphins jersey before the touchup. Why would you include like a dark blue lining there? What was the point? Why did you get rid of the orange? And with the lakers, why did you change the color to banana yellow? Do us a favor, and stick with the colors that are already provided. Don’t change them, don’t add anything new, stick with the old colors.

2. Trying to incorporate their own design
Look I get that you want to make teams unique, like Syracuse with gradients, or the seahawks with that weird helmet design, but what people prefer is simpler classic looking jerseys. How many people do you see complaining about the cowboys uniforms, the crimson tide, or the Celtics classic greens? Every year, the lowest ranked jerseys in college football, professional football, and professional basketball are the ones that have too much going on or trying to incorporate their own “new” look.

And probably the most important one
3. What’s your problem with block style numbers?

Seriously did a kid wearing a block style jersey bite your balls off as a kid? There’s nothing wrong with keeping the numbers in the standard football font. Every now and then a different font looks good on a particular jersey (IE Bears, Steelers maybe), but 99% of the fonts Nike creates to add flair look very shit.

I don’t want to rat on Syracuse again but their old uniforms in college football had the most disgusting number font. You’ve made LSU’s font look like it was put through a taffy puller. You make the Dolphins numbers look like a malnourished child. You made the seminoles numbers look like they could rip my finger off just touching a jersey. 

Block style numbers aren’t bad, simplicity and the classic “football” looking uniforms are what people prefer. Pitt’s and Syracuse’s new uniforms this season are a step in the right direction, and even the Detroit Lions look alright, but you fucked with the numbers again on all 3. Please stop with that shit. 

Nike, just keep the classic colors, don’t try to add some “unique” flair to a uniform that doesn’t need it, and stay away from any number font that’s not a form of block style

49,Running om treadmill with Nikeeees,"
I’m running on a treadmill in the gym and i’m currently wearing the nike air huarache. However they lack support and stability therefore im looking for a new pair of running/training shoes. Also they are worn out quite a bit. I was wondering if any of these nike shoes would be a good choice: 
- Nike Vapormax
- Nike air presto
- Nike air max 98 (highly doubt) 
- any of the tuned air shoes
- nike zoom spiridon 
- nike p-6000 (will there be a men’s version???)

127,I'm having a really bad experience with Nike returns and am not sure if it's even going to be resolved,"I received a pair of Nike Komyuter SE shoes at the beginning of January and was truly hyped as they look perfect on the outside. Unfortunately, to me, the pair I have is defective as the lace mechanism literally unties itself as soon as make two steps. The size I ordered is identical to the size of my previous nikes, which are the most comfortable and fitting shoe I own. The older model has normal ties, which do not loosen in any way, and I simply love wearing them. Unfortunately, the Komyuters are the opposite and they feel like they will fall of my shoes after the very first steps I take with them, regardless of how tight I make them. The mechanism does not hold the laces at all and simply loosens as soon as you move your feet in the shoes. I contacted Nike about it and they said the shoe should be ordered 1 size below your normal size - something that is not indicated anywhere in the description. This is not really true, because at the same time I ordered 1 pair smaller Komyuters from a different shop, as this size was no longer available from Nike official. And what do you know, it fit kind of better, but the mechanism was the same crappy design that loosens itself as soon as you start walking. To me, the whole design of this model is defective as the little mechanism that holds the ties at the back of the shoe is incapable of holding them and lets go as soon as you move your feet. What's funny is that the smaller shop honored my return request, sent me a DHL pick up for free, and refunded me within a week. Something Nike is seemingly incapable of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I contacted Nike at the start of January and they sent me the first return label. I live in the Balkans, EU and since it was delivered by DHL, I presumed I need to personally go to a DHL office and let them scan the label and pick up the box as no further explanation was given except the label and a ""preferred pickup date"". That was the first waste of time I went through, as DHL explained this is not their label and there's nothing they can do (and their office is at the other end of the city...). I contacted Nike and they explained to me for the very first time that it's a pickup they do with a different delivery company, one which never arrived nor contacted me in any way to seek me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward through Janury and the beginning of February and 3 more return labels have been issued for me, of which NONE were picked up - no contact over the phone, no nothing. I waited at my office all day long without leaving the premises for 3 different days and felt like and idiot that was simply lied to. It seems they only issued return labels but never sent anyone to pick them up, which is ridiculous as I had only heard good things about their support.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, after they did not respond to my last request for an actual resolution to this issue in days, I wrote to them that I will be contacting my bank and card issuer to seek help from them in any way I can. I've honestly had enough. Thankfully, the shoes were purchased during a period where the return limit is increased to 60 days, but it seems Nike has no interest to resolve this given what has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if anyone has had such an experience but I honestly can't recommend this shoe, or the nike online shop to anyone after going through it. And I am not sure if a chargeback would be possible, but in my experience I paid a premium price for a defective pair of shoes that untie themselves instantly after you start walking.",Nike,1550557953,b_fnk,2,1,True,2019-02-19

# INSIDE THE VAULT

##### THE STORY OF SAFARI

For Tinker Hatfield, ideas are a culmination of all your experiences and interactions up until that point. Anything and everything is of inspiration. Take for example, the 1987 Nike Air Safari. At the time, Tinker knew what he wanted to do with the shoe that introduced Safari print to the world, but how it was going to be done was still up in the air.  


“I had this feeling that luxury, comfort and the idea of taking an athletic shoe and purposely making it non athletic was a good idea”, Hatfield shared as he reminisced on the Nike Air Safari. “So I drew this up and presented it but I didn’t even have any materials chosen. I jumped on a plane to New York City and was just roaming around. I remember I went into this furniture store, the kind that you have to get buzzed in.""

I walked through the basketball section of my local sports store and noticed how utterly ugly basketball shoes have gotten with no obvious tech upgrades. I’ve been out of school for 3 years now thus never having a need to go out and buy new cleats or shoes to replace my worn footwear. I remember the Hyperfuse material, Nike Flywire tech, Flyknit, the bags of air etc and how truly revolutionary all of it was.

I own 2 pairs of Nike hyper dunk 2012 (low and a high), and hyper dunks 14-15 high and 16 low (in my opinion the 2012 hyperdunk low is by far the greatest hyperdunk yet, nothing about it from traction, upper quality and stitching, weight, fit, or aesthetic etc is flawed). I own Jordans 28-30 all of which are absolutely fantastic shoes, and revolutionary in their own regards (maybe not the 30 but the 28 and 29 for sure). I own magistas, and mercurials top of the line for their respective year, I own multiple vapours for football and just recently replaced my old hockey skates with top of the line baur nexus 1n skates. 

I look at all of these footwear and I can’t help but feel like we’re peaking in terms of tech. Maybe not so much hockey skates, but the tech being used on football cleats, soccer cleats and basketball shoes are almost a decade old. Basketball shoes are hideous now a days with no new tech. Like in what way can you improve on the Jordan 29? That shoe was perfect! How could you possible beat a fully flyknit upper? The traction was absolutely ridiculous and the rigidity was perfect. I can’t help but feel Nike and other sports companies are trying desperately to save and spread out old tech because the sports wear industry has peaked tech wise.

84,Honest opinion about nike support,"Hey i just want to share my experience with you, and ask for your help, read through this if you are a sneaker expert or have had any good/bad experiences with customer service,

So about an hour ago i contacted nike support with a complaint about a Nike Air Jordan 1 Mid, and how the retailer i bought it from didnt really care, it had warranty tho.

So i tried to tell them everything that was wrong with the shoe, like: (pictures will be below)

 **Jen**: Aside from this concern, will there be anything else?   
**Farkas**: you guys made that sneaker, and after 2 weeks, the glue of the artificial leather resolved, because of raindrops  
**Farkas**: the jordan 1 mid sneaker had bubbles on it only because rain  

Extra funny: even 2 of my friends told me that they had the exact same problem with exactly the same shoe

So the support lady just dodged all my bullets, and then shut the chat down.

1. It's not normal that a sneaker falls apart because some drops of rain.
2. I didn't ever have high hopes for these capitalist companies,

BUT 

when i had the same problem with LEGO:

I bought a minifigure pack,that had a broken piece in it, and i had a kind of similar chat with a lego assistant, they sent me a brand new packet right after. Not a replacement piece! A pack!

If you want i can show pictures about that too.

SO, that really grinds my gears, how they just tried to ignore my complaint. I know that it's a profit oriented company, but sometimes they should care about their customers because not everyone could afford another €170 shoe, especially here in hungary. (&lt;- worst country in eu xd), I will probably try to write to the consumer protection agency, but here its also pretty poor.

&amp;#x200B;

Any bad experience of yours with support

349,Recommendations for/anyone out there with cancer-related skin GvHD?,"My feet are super tore up from skin GvHD. Especially the skin on the anterior portion of the ankle joint. Just destroyed. The Dr. suggested it might be aggravated by mechanical destruction brought on by the tongue of my sneakers (it's a low tongue and lines up with the wounds). I'm wondering if someone has any suggestions for a sneaker model that won't eat into my feet.

I bought a pair of  SB Zoom Dunk High Elites in a 13 (a size that's never failed me before in a Nike) because they essentially didn't even have a tongue but I absolutely could not even fit my foot in (bought them on ebay, can I return them to Nike?)!

I thought the High Vandal Supremes might be good bcs they're a softer material but I'm very concerned about breath-ability. Also the price, what with being out of work.

I can't tell if high tops would be better because that portion of the foot is tied in tight or if it would be worse bcs of all the additional tongue contact. Ditto a big, plushy tongue.

I have had these shorts for well over 15 years (I remember wearing them before high school and I graduated in 2006); if I had a cloning machine with only three charges I would insert these shorts in there three times.  They are soft (because they are all cotton?), breathable but not too thin, flexible (the elastic waistband and drawstring means they are secure always) and the inner liner means I don't have to wear a pair of compression shorts underpants.  The pockets and coin pouch are just a plus: I wear these constantly, both working out and not working out.  Are these shorts made any more?

I was told the perfect fit for me would be the model Nike Air Pegasus. Another person told me the Nike Air Zoom Structure 21 would probably be just as good and also appears to be on sale right now.

What are your thoughts on those two pair of shoes ?

Also, I'm trying to get into basket-ball a little bit (I play outside) and have seen an interesting offer in another shop for a pair of Jordan Relentless Nike or some Nike Air Versitile with some other shoes.

What about those, are those good for playing basket-ball ? What's the difference between all those sneakers ?

On this shoe that rubber part is not, let's say, tightly fixed to the other part of the sole like on the other shoe and It can move so I guess it's making noise cause of friction between those two parts of the sole and it's irritating me so damn hard.. I red somewhere that i can stick needle threw the little hole (and potentially inject some small amount of wd40) that's located under sole, but I'm not sure  that that hole goes right to the part that is problematic for me and I'm afraid that if I do that , I might get threw the air part and maybe cut the part of the sole that's filled with air. I can't find good repairman (everyone told me that it's not fixable) so I want to try something by myself or il just throw them away because they squeak so so loudly... I wore a lot of nikes and this is first time this happens to me and only this pair is bought from official nike store, so you can't tell they are fake (I mean they rly look like they are high quality, so I don't think they are fake).

59,Nike should turn footwork into artwork..and how this put me in the hospital,"This is a fairly long story.  Let me explain my idea first.

I call it Foot Scribbling.  This idea popped in my head in the Winter about 8 years ago or so, I ran down a parking lot that had been covered in a light snow and slid lines into the surface and made a diamond shape.  I live in the Northeast US and for the next few years spent a lot of time experimenting with this idea.  I'm a avid runner and would be out in the Winter showing up to parking lots and later to cinder paths and using all the footwork drills I've learned, making patterns and textures and getting some results.  Icky shuffle, spins, backpedals, turns, skips.  Letting the residual lines turn into artwork all left on the ground.  

I also started to contact various figures at local universities and trying to get more information on whether this was done before.  Ya know, just whether there was anything similar.  I ended up getting some feedback.  A professor at one of the local universities filled me in on a theatre production called ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.""  It was a play where a spelling bee contestant uses his feet to spell the words on the ground.  It was whimsical, imaginary, and not nearly as edgy as my interpretation of this concept.  So the idea isn't wholly original, but it never stopped me from pursuing more information and I ended talking about this concept to other people with movement experience or a strong business acumen.  

From there it hit me, what if Nike made a pair of shoes that someone could put on where they could walk out their door onto pavement or blacktop and create artwork.  I had surmised that if the artwork was water-soluble and impermanent it would appeal to the masses.  Maybe there is a cartridge of some sort that you put in the shoe, I'm not entirely sure.  This is where I naturally came into a stopping point.  I don't have Phil Knight or Tinker Hatfield as contacts but I figured Nike is the best company to engineer the shoe and market it.  And if there was such a shoe that existed, would you really question as to whether people would buy it?  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that if a shoe existed, and it legitimately gave people the ability to create artwork with their feet that they would buy it.  

I had stretched this idea as far as I could and over time had contacted and discussed my concept with 3 Ivy League business graduates/consultants.  The input I had received was always positive.  It isn't a perfect concept, but what I believe to be a possible concept.  Engineering a shoe such as this is undoubtedly not easy.  

It is a form of movement that would likely better one's proprioception and footwork.  If someone could walk outside and made like 8 lines that turned into a bird or something fairly simple it would probably be pretty cool.  If you were a breakdancer, basketball player or ballerina it would likely interest you as a mover to be able to buy a pair of shoes that helped you with footwork where you could also make shapes and gave you feedback.  

If you can imagine my idea watch Les Twins on Youtube and visualize those two dancers with this pair of shoes.  They are brilliant movers and I'm convinced they could really bring this to life.  Just watch their feet.

So I think you understand my idea.  It isn't the hardest concept to grasp.  And this is where the story goes for a twist.  

So January of 2017, I contact one of my old classmates at Springfield College in MA.  We talked on the internet and videochatted about the idea and I told him I wanted to pitch my idea at the school.  Being a graduate of Springfield College and knowing the history of the school, it just made the most sense.  Springfield College is the birthplace of basketball, an alum invented volleyball and they have ties everywhere in the sports world.  I was just getting ready to draft an email and seek out the most likely professors for feedback.  It was the easiest point of entrance.  And then, by chance I spot on my feed on Instagram two trainers on the internet imitating my idea in sand.  Both with huge followings and connected to a company that's mission is to bring movement to life through technology.  Mind you I was already suspicious of the local world threading itself into my IG feed and convinced that there was a way you could subliminally message through the feed.  I immediately contacted my classmate and told him that I thought my idea was submitted.  Mind you other members of the company and their trainers were interacting with my feed the next two months and liking the pictures I was posting.  I became convinced my idea had been submitted by this third-party.  They were simulataneously showing up on my feed while I was getting interaction from the companies trainers on my IG.  Mind you the same company is also the most represented Yoga platform on IG, and I was in the middle of developing a pretty strong yoga practice myself.

It almost appeared as if my idea had been submitted so naturally I seek out the two people whom will help me the most if this were true.  My brother and my therapist.  My brother is a intellectual property lawyer and my therapist just happens to be a business consultant with an ivy league degree whom also has experience in Intellectual property.  I'll never forget scheduling that appointment with my therapist and showing him that video on Instagram and him looking at me and believing me.  My brother believed me initially too.  So there I go screenshotting the history of my feed and highly suspicious of the people whom I thought submitted it.  And there they were on my feed, feeding my bias simultaneously.  It was like a perfect storm.  

I will also note that it seemed believable that the people within this grouping knew because I had actually mentioned my idea in strong detail to other parties heavily involved with this other group.  People that know of me more than anything.  It is a small enough community around here that it really seemed convincing.  People I'd run into at any local coffee shop or down the street and because of the circumstances I never really involved myself too much with them.  Then I'd reload my IG feed and they'd show up with some of the oddest posts at the time that convinced me further they had done something. 

So I talk to the people I trust initially, for the most part try to keep it hush hush and wait for what I thought was a representative or someone from the company to show up and talk to me.  And last April I'm just waiting, and waiting, and waiting all the while posting things to my IG account that I thought would garner appropriate attention.  And oddly enough it did.  I didn't even hashtag the waterfalls I was posting and then receiving enough attention to my IG account from much of the yoga world on IG.  Which furthered me into thinking that it must be sorta known and they must be clarifying whose idea it was since I didn't actually submit it myself.  Mind you over the next 6-8 months my account had increased exposure and attention, I was followed by a Nike trainer, somebody wrote money on the picture I put out of my family, and the things showing up on my feed were just so odd.  It's like going down a rabbit hole that built this confirmation bias in my mind that confused and convinced me more than anything that this was happening.

And in truth I always thought I was talented enough to be on the IG platform and train.  That is how people perceive me, as an athlete.  I don't exaggerate my talents as an athlete but I was getting into press handstands, my arm balances were coming along and I was talking to someone about becoming a yoga teacher.  I'm also a very talented runner and jumper.  Never was gonna make the olympics, but I'm 5'9 and was basically dunking basketballs in my prime.  I was and am a pretty decent athlete.  Played college football, ran college track.  Learned yoga with literally no experience and excelled to the point of being a very strong practitioner with a lot of room to get better.  And, I was.  I was honestly convinced that I was being taken on by this platform on the internet and they had received my idea from a third-party who I was waiting to come out of the woodworks.  I would be wrong.

I had essentially said nothing for many of the coming months and my brother at some point must of poked enough holes to realize it wasn't exactly true.  His explanation was simple, if someone from Nike had been contacted they'd have contacted you.  Through all the things I was seeing on social media my vision became blurred.  At this point I find it kind of hilarious that I didn't listen to my brother.  He only graduated at Summa Cum Laude from law school and was receiving strong praise in the law world, mind you he literally reads and makes decisions on these types of things on a professional and regular basis, so I should have halted my preconceived notions on the situation and just realized I was wrong.  Nobody wants to hear from their brother that he believes they're delusional.  The unfortunate thing is I was gripped by the things I was seeing on my feed and thinking they had all these meanings that I was interpreting, which is a dangerous game to play on Instagram.  I also was talking to my brothers girlfriend about this who happens to be a law student at Yale and I wouldn't say I convinced her, but she wasn't telling me that I was obviously full of sheeeet.  It was just so weird.  I was convinced there was this big legal mishap and that they had submitted my idea as being one of the originators themselves so the company couldn't properly give credit to me.

I waited, and waited, and waited.  And was following my feed for literal feedback and come to the conclusion that the same people that had submitted my idea were now turned against me for not seeking them out.  I basically in my own mind put myself out there just enough to seem like I was cooperating with this group.  Or willing to cooperate even though there was many reasons for which I would not want to.  My mind ended up building explanations where I needn't build explanations.  So the two girls whom I thought submitted it, I all of a sudden thought they were trying to ruin me which was like April of this year.  The group whom I thought submitted it were turned against me and I was screenshotting everything.  I mean 1000's of screenshots from the follwing year.  All supporting this alter-universe from the social media platforms.  It's like I don't even want to get into the things that I saw.  So someone with which I thought knew what was going on I had mistakenly emailed thinking while she is just waiting for this to happen and I thought she knew.  I had tried to have humility and not toot my own horn as the person that just invented this so I never said anything to her and then the last two months all these things came up and I ended up sounding like a crazy person.  I sprained my elbow and tried to plead my case while she met with me to tell me this wasn't happening.  I ended up not believing her and was convinced she was trying to keep me quiet until everything was worked out.  I ended up sending two emails which to this day I'm more embarrassed and ashamed of then I've ever been.  It's like I thought the group whom submitted it were trying to plant this #metoo movement on me and I flipped out.  I'm not Kavanaugh, and in some hilarious way it was nothing.

Low and behold that same person whom I emailed called the cops on me.  I remember going out on a Friday morning with these bags from my closet and just like in the weirdest place in my life.  Two cops approach me and I got sent to the Psychiatric evaluation unit.  I spent 13 days in the hospital convinced all these things were happening and it took me like another 3 weeks to believe they weren't.  It was really an incredibly embarrassing experience and I just really wish I never saw the trainers imitating my idea in the sand spinning about.  I was naive, no doubt about it.  In hindsight it was probably the right thing to do considering I sounded like a crazy person when I really think about the contents of the email and what I was otherwise saying.    

There are numerous things I'm leaving out for which I might be able to explain.  I just wanted to leave names and certain details out because it isn't appropriate especially considering I was just building this story in my head.  I got rid of my social media accounts and holed myself up for months too embarrassed to walk out the door.  I don't consider myself too irrational or lacking complete intuition when it comes to people.  I'm widely misunderstood by some people but I usually read into things with some accuracy.  And while I don't like getting on the mental illness train I was diagnosed with OCD while I was in the psych unit.  Something I already knew about myself.  I mean it was odd enough talking to someone in the unit who watched me play football growing up and verbatim when he took me out of the unit looked at me and sarcastically said ""don't beat me up.""  It's because my reputation with people is that I'm a very good athlete and that was one of the opposing coaches that I played football against in high school.  

Just the whole experience is weird and still is.  And truthfully I want to know if other people can imagine the concept.  Do you think Nike could make this shoe?  Would you try it?  Would you want those shoes?  Do you think it's possible someone could get so misled by social media?  Do people need more of an explanation around the third party of people whom I thought submitted?

I'll answer questions best I can.  The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and I wish I had went to Springfield before I saw that on Instagram.  It was this weird syncronicity that royally messed with my head.  And I had actually posted pics of the artwork on on feed which is another weird detail.  I didn't post videos but I did post pics of the results.  I made this feather working on the press handstands that to this day I think could be replicated and I could teach.  No matter.

76,Bad experience at Nike factory store. Were they justified?,"I bought a pair of shoes on Tuesday. Today (Friday), I went there again to shop for another pair. I saw they had a 20% additional sale off the lowest markdown item. I happened to have the receipt for the item I bought on Tuesday. I also had the empty box in the back of my car. So I thought great, I'll get a price adjustment. Employee X asked the manager if they can do this. He said no. I told employee X ok what if I return it and buy it right back? She said you can do that, but might risk the original price of the shoes having gone back up. I said ok can you check what the price would be today? She clicked some keys on her keyboard and said the price would be the same as Tuesday's. In other words, she was saying leading me to believe that the item's lowest ticket had gone up, and the 20% discount would bring it back to Tuesday's price. I had a feeling she wasn't being truthful. So I went to the back of the store, grabbed an identical pair on the wall, and asked another unsuspecting manager (Manager Y) to give me a price check. Manager Y was very cordial. She confirmed what I knew. The quoted price was lower. Employee X had lied to get rid of me. I went to get the shoe box from my car and my receipt. Manager Y happened to be at the cash register to ring people up. I went and asked to return my shoes and buy it right back. Suddenly her demeanor changed and she was no longer nice. She was being argumentative with me saying ""you can't do that"". Finally, she went ahead and did it. This was just outrageous.

Comfort: Nike Free x Metcon --&gt; Nike Free TR V8 --&gt; Zoom Train Command.  The Zoom Train commands soles are just too flat (probably why it's a boxing shoe). It wouldn't be very comfortable running or jumping or walking long distances imo. It's a pretty close though between the Nike Free TR V8 / Metcons.   
I might just end up getting the Metcons / TR V8's. 

Although I'm not digging that limited edition colorway on the metcons in person so I'll probably return those.

178,Just DONT.,"That's right. Just don't. Don't buyem. I had a pair of bikes one time and they wore out and the souls of the shoes got messed up. It took a few years if brutal abuse but after only 2 weeks the front part started peeling back like a weird flopping mouth on the front of the shoes.  Like it was too complicated to put actual stitching on the front to hold it in place instead the 3m glue they thought would hold the rubber did not. Really it's not about the shitty but decent shoes it's about their crap brand and also decision to hire Colin Crapernik to be their spokes person. I am personally offended by his Jew fro and black panther starter kit. He is not from wakanda and I'm Jewish and can see a Jew from a mile away. This guy's a fraud. 

It's about this: this douche kapernik took a dick I mean knee during the national anthem in an NFL game on the in front of millions and then claimed he felt oppressed. He was a black guy half white who was raised by both white parents wealthy at that, and he sucked as a QB so he got put into backup role even tho he was still on a 100 million dollar contract. Hes a bit of a bitch so he couldn't handle being a shitty backup, so he walked away from the job. He quit. Other teams saw how much he sucked and how much he wanted to make and did not decide to hire him after he quit while taking that $$. So they didn't hire him. Remember he's a bit of a bitch right so my dude starts claiming he is oppressed and blames white people and claims to be the spokesperson for black people (hence the Jew fro and black panther leather starter kit). So then he makes commercials and Sue's the NFL once he can no longer even get them on the telephone. And then Nike makes the retarded decision to hire him for a commercial and ad campaign they are currently regretting... Because they, like most of the internet, underestimate how much real Americans don't give a fuck about you we just dont you're bushit and drama... Also, we love America and it really is equal, unless you're a bit of a bitch. 

Love it. Kap is a pos. Nike sucks. Go Trump. Maga. 

Also, Kap looks stupid with his 1970s afro and is the worst possible person other than maybe Rosie odonnel, to represent black America in their efforts to make what is already a biased system of helping blacks first even more one sided. He is rich, he grew up wealthy raised by white folks and has never been or felt oppression anymore than any other white man... And gasp white people feel oppression as well. The system is rigged to help black people, look at equal rights movements and BET... Or black history month. Where's WET... OR white history month, or white panther. Think for yourselves.

If it we're about equality, we would be having different conversations. This is about another race wanting superiority and it isn't the white race. This is also about Kap wanting to stay relevant, but he hasn't and he won't. 5 years and he dies off completely.. like Ryan Leaf.

Further, people are so incredibly butthurt about Trump taking away societies political correctness that they are looking for every outlet to frustrate him and his agenda. Maga.

179,"What is this all about, Mr. Kaepernick?"," Let me first start by saying I fully believe that it is a person’s right to peacefully protest however they choose to do it. “Peaceful protest” is not altered because people are angered by it. If NFL players taking a knee pisses you off, that is a YOU-problem. I wish they would not do it, but they have that right. Secondly, congratulations to Mr. Kaepernick on the big Nike contract – this is what capitalism is all about.  
However, I am confused about the issues now. First it was police brutality, then it was social injustice, now it is what?  
*Let’s talk about it.*  
This movement has taken a lot of turns.  
This all began on August 26, 2016 when Colin Kaepernick decided to sit during the national anthem. After the game he said ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Then within a week, he wore socks that depicted police officers as pigs – which happens to be derogatory in nature. He associated those socks with “rogue cops.” Which is what these police officers who shoot unarmed people are – rogue. Every profession, ethnicity, community, etc … has bad apples; police officers are not immune to it. Kaepernick also followed this up with the revelation that he does not vote **and** that he had not, to that point, donated any of his money to help causes he is protesting.  
To sum it up, Kaepernick protested, then wore derogatory socks that portrayed a community as a whole but tried to say it was only meant for the few, then said he doesn’t vote, and then sad he doesn’t donate money – but he wants people to fix the problems. I’m confused too.  
Then it was showtime. Kaepernick began defending Fidel Castro’s policies. He said that Castro put more money into the education system than the prison system. That could be because Cuba did not need a prison, seeing as how they would assassinate you in your house, *in front of your kids* – but, apparently, that type of oppression can be overlooked if we throw a little extra money into the school system. Now I’m even more confused.  
Whether you agree or not, this made Kaepernick the face of the NFL protest. Now it doesn’t matter how well Malcom Jenkins handles it, this is Kaepernick’s battle and it always will be.  
Kaepernick claims to be “fight oppression of all kinds globally.” Just go look at his website.  
Nike’s checkbook may have changed that stance, though.  
Why? Well……  
In August 2018 a class action suit was filed against Nike by women. Among the allegations were:  


1. Executives were calling female counterparts “dykes” on “several occasions.”
2. A female employee started and was told her wage was “non-negotiable.” 2 months later, a male counterpart was hired to the same position but at a higher salary.
3. A male co-worker sent nude photographs to a female co-worker and followed that with more harassing text messages. After the female co-worker told the male co-worker to stop, the male co-worker began withholding information from the female co-worker. That information was imperative for the female co-worker to perform her job. The make co-worker also began skipping meetings that the female co-worker schedule and encouraged other co-workers to skip the meetings as well.
4. HR was informed of all of these incidents, but never took action.

I know what you might be saying – “these are just allegations.” That is my first response also. However, Nike publicly said they have “failed to promote enough women and minorities” and also said they have cultural issues. That is as close to an admission as you will get regarding allegations.  
What about those Nike sweatshops? Since the 1990’s Nike has used Chinese sweatshops to create their products. The workforce there, which is mostly women, works 60-84 hours a week, roughly 16 hours a day – but “earn” on average $62 a week. These shops have been criticized for using children in their factory’s and working them at the same rates for even less money. That sounds a little bit like slavery.  
How does Nike think they can be forgiven the quickest? Maybe sign Colin Kaepernick because he “fights oppression.”  
But let me ask you this Mr. Kaepernick, what about that oppression against “women and minorities?” Is it just about the money? What about Nike taking advantage of children in China to save a few dollars in the U.S.? Adidas and Puma were recruiting you for the same thing, why choose Nike when they have this type of systematic oppression going on in their own building? I thought we were fighting all social injustice here?  
A lot of this is confusing.  
But I do know one thing, if signing a multi-million dollar, multi-year deal with Nike is “sacrificing everything,” sign me up.

358,"Looking to Identify these Nikes I thrifted with no Size Tag / Art Number, Anyone help?","I was out thrifting today, you know, ballin on a budget. I was out looking sneakers to restore or customize and I came across these nikes for a few bucks that looks like AF1 but older. No AIR logo on it and the sizing tag must have been removed because I cannot seem to find it anywhere. No box either. I am just getting into the sneaker world and have enjoyed restoring a couple pairs and custom painting a pair so I am not to knowledgeable on a lot of sneakers out there yet. I am a noobie, go easy on me!

429,Customer support issue,"Forgive me for the formatting, but I’m on mobile. 

I bought a pair of PG2s 2-3 months ago and the rubber molding at the toe is starting to peel off (it’s an obvious defect, more than normal wear and tear, but can post a picture if needed). I only play basketball once a week and the shoes have only been worn on an indoor court, they still look practically brand new except for the defect. 

I bought the shoes from Champs and started by going there first and understandably they said it was a manufacturing issue and that Nike should handle it. So I go into a Nike store and they only want to give me a store credit for what the shoes are currently selling for ($55 since the PG 2.5 came out recently). I originally paid $110 for the shoes.

So I left the store and I called customer support and was told I would have to send the shoes in, but that I have to pay for the shipping. So my dilemma is that after paying $10-20 for shipping I’ll still probably only get the $55 store credit from Nike anyway. So I’m contemplating if I should just take their offer at the actual store and get a new pair of shoes or keep them. I can still play in the shoes but I’m worried they’re just going to get worse. 

I was wondering if anyone has had similar issues with a defective product and issues with Nike customer support and how/if it was resolved.

477,Nike AF1 82 Authentic ?,"I was at a Church tag sale on Saturday. This church has this tag sale 4 or 5 times a year and I usually find some great stuff there to sell on ebay. There is a house or two attached to the Church and they always have a tag sale on the same day since they share a yard with the Church. Anyway in front of the house there was stuff setup like there usually was and this kid no older than 7 was selling some things. Everything was super cheap $1-$3, but most of it was in terrible condition. Anyway I saw these Nike shoes there and with the green color I figured even though it was in terrible condition maybe I could sell it on ebay for $20 or something, because I know there are people out there that buy things on ebay for other uses than they are supposed to be used. I have seen people turn things into art projects or some people just collect regardless of condition etc. Whatever thats all beside the point...

Question here is I put the shoes on ebay. At the moment I just put a placeholder price tag of $175 until I researched them a bit more, but most likely I was going to change it to $17.50 if I found out they were worth nothing. I paid $2 for these shoes. During my research someone messaged me a very nasty messaging saying I am trying to sell bootleg shoes. I have no idea why this guy is accusing me of this as I said I bought them for a 7 year old. Can someone verify if these shoes are actually authentic and what they are exactly? Thank you and as you can see I am a super amateur at this.
