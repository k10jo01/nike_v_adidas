I was going to order a 7.5 just to be sure but I have been reading that men’s shoes tend to be wider anyway and have a larger toe box. If so should i just stick to a 7 than a 7.5? Or is the safest best just to get the 7.5?",Nike,1568443108,buzzbuzzbih,3,0,True,2019-09-14

74,Nike.com gift card ridiculous policies!,"Last year in November I received 2 gift card of $500 HKD from my wife.   I figured it's September now it's time to use it before it expires.  
 

What happened was the shittiest online ordering experience ever.

First, apparently I can't use 2 gift cards at once in the same order.  If I buy a pair of shoes for $1200 I can only use 1 card.  Which means I have to pay $700 to get the pair of shoes I want, and find another $500 worth of product to finish up the last card.

Secondly, I input the gift card information and decided to not place the order at the checkout (ie refresh the page because I couldn't find an option to use 2 cards at once), the next time I entered the card info, it displays I have $0.00 left on the card balance.  Naturally I called customer service and I was told once I input the card information, their system will hold my money for 24 hours regardless I place the order or not.   

When I asked your customer service over the phone what happens when the gift card expires while my fund is being held, she just said unfortunately the fund will be lost.

Someone please verify with me on these information, I would like to know for sure if I was just misinformed by an lazy customer service representative.  Otherwise, this has to be the crappiest gift card system I've ever seen from a large company.",Nike,1568532065,danhoyuen,6,4,True,2019-09-15

128,Nike Returns Policy,"Now the new football (soccer) season has now started I wanted to get a new pair of boots but £200+ is a fee I'd rather not pay. Then i came across the returns policy:
&gt; We design our shoes and gear to help you perform at peak level, so if they're not working exactly right for you, we've got you covered. When you buy on Nike.com, we provide you 30 days from the delivery date to take your Nike or Hurley purchases for a trial run, confidently knowing you can return (or exchange) any item (some exceptions apply) for any reason within 30 days. That even includes custom Nike By You sneakers. No questions asked and no delivery costs for NikePlus Members. And after 30 days, you can still return items if they're unworn and unwashed.

So go ahead, shop with confidence and enjoy your 30-day, risk-free trial.

From my understanding this means that I can buy a pair of boots, train and play in them for 25ish days, return them (most likely not in a resellable condition), receive my refund and buy another new pair, then rinse and repeat for the whole season.

I had a chat with a friend today who said that one of his friends did this last season so he basically had a new pair of boots every month and Nike never stopped him. At face value this would suggest I'm fine to do the same and have new boots each month and return them at the end of that month but I find it hard to believe that Nike won't suspend me from returning items if I continue to buy and return the same item (potentially different CW but still) each month. If I think about it from their perspective, they have no reason not to stop me from doing this; it's not like they're going to lose a customer if they do so, and I'm pushing my luck by doing this so I can't really angry if they do lol.

If you've exploited their returns policy like this or in a similar way please reply with your experiences, whether you've been banned/suspended or warned by Nike or never had an issue, I'm very interested to hear if anyone else has done this. Cheers",Nike,1568843997,owxnw14,2,0,True,2019-09-18

416,Calling all Nike Free RN vets,"I started wearing free runs in 2016 and what I liked most about them was the minimal cushioning. As the years went on it seems they are adding more and more cushion- which I personally don't like. I don't feel grounded in cushion-y shoes. 

Has anyone tried the newest models of the shoe- or similar models? Do any of them feel ""minimal"" or anything like the older versions? 

And bonus points if you can point me toward other popular shoe brands that have good minimal ""running"" shoes. Most of the adidas shoes I've tried (as nice as they look) are way to cushion-y. 

These shoes aren't for running purposes- just something stylish/athletic with minimal cushioning and well built. 

With the 2016-2017 free runs.

Sadly, I can't really find them in my size anywhere anymore, so now I'm looking for a shoe that basically has the same fit as these ones, from a current collection. Specifically, the soft heel. Most Nike shoes I've had have a sort of plastic support in the heel which always ends up breaking and sawing into my Achilles tendon, and the Stefan Janoski ones with their soft, unsupported heel don't. If anyone knows of a current shoe with such a heel (and preferably the same kind of blue, though that's more of a 'nice to have') it would be greatly appreciated. Considering different markets and whatnot, I should probably mention I'm from the Netherlands. Thanks in advance!

* ordered custom shoes and order gets canceled for unknown reasons
* try to reorder shoes with a customer service rep and give my CC over the phone and i was told i cannot buy the shoe i wanted because the custom shoes i wanted are no longer available. (thats right fokes, * * you think you are making custom shoes but in reality they just make a bunch of different colors and dont release them until ordered) this also means they run out and you cannot get them anymore.
* select a different shoe order them and still my order gets canceled (OMG are you serious)
* i reorder after creating a new account and guess what the shoes are not available.
* i talk to customer service and they give me 2 promo codes (20% off and free next day shipping)i was explicitly told to use the promo codes together.
* i pick out new shoes and go to use the promo codes and i am not able to use both together (@at this point i am buying 6 pairs of off the shelf shoes and 3 customs)
* i call customer service and they say a manager will call me back in 2 hours
* i wait and guess what one of my shoes that are custom made are no longer available
* i call back and i was told the same thing give them an hour or so to get free and a manager will address all my issues
* i wait again ( lost another shoe) ugh .. .
* i get irritated with waiting and end up with using one 1 promo code
* i call back and get another rep that tells me well if they cancel the order they can apply both promo codes ( i declined because i am not loosing the last custom shoe i made)
* i was told they will have a manager call me back with in an hour
* next day told the same thing
* i contacted support 9 times over the course of the day, never once getting to a manager and now i am being told that i will not receive a call back until 1-2 days of business and they never guarantee that it will be a call or within an hour.

**** i am just done..... *****

there is a 90% chance that they will end up getting there shoes back and i will just go to ADIDAS

290,Are they too small or is it okay?,"Hi there! 

So I purchased some Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe in a size 7 (typically my size) when they were on sale last week, online. I've been saving up to buy a nice sneaker because I am on my feet a lot and have a big trip coming up.  I usually buy whatever the cheapest costco sneaker is and it's been perfectly fine till now.

I thought I'd splurge a little on a basic Nike sneaker.  I think I got the pair for $60~.  

My only concern is I got them in and I've been walking around in them and it does seem like they might be too small.  It actually fits REALLY WELL everywhere except the tip of my toe.  I'm a bit surprised how awesome everything else feels.  I thought there was a little room left but as I am walking in them through the day, my toe nails have gotten kinda achey.  

I think the sale is over so I was wondering if you guys think it'd be okay if they ""break in""?  Will they stretch out a little you guys think?  

I don't think the Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe comes in a 7.5...but I actually can't find this shoe on the website anymore (i might be blind).  

I'm in a weird time in my life right now so I can't really afford anything better so it would be great if maybe these would stretch out a bit.  I'm being very careful with my money right now.

Any suggestions of another style would be great!  Basically looking for the most budget shoe Nike offers (really impressed by the cushion on this pair) that will help my feet walking around for 8-9 hours a day.  I can spend upwards of $80 but it's a bit of a stretch for me, so that's why I was so happy to catch the Nike Free RN 2018 Women's Running Shoe on sale last week.

316,Heel Slip on Metcon 5 X. What do,"Hi guys. So I was in the hunt for some Romaleos 3 XD for gym but I realised how much of dedicated lifting shoe they are that the sales person turned me to the Metcon 5's. I do a lot more than lifts in the gym and while not a dedicated lifting shoe, thought it would me the versatility I need.

So I bought them retail. US 9, the same as every single other pair of Nike shoes I own. I tried thick and thin socks and got mad heel slip. The forefoot of the shoe felt perfect but the heel slipped on every single stride.

Went back to the store and modified the lacing pattern a bit which helped, but damn son, it was still there. They didn't have 8.5's but I tried 8's on kicks and the heel slip stopped so I'm putting this down to sizing.

It's so odd. I've never had this before on any nike shoes. I know that the heel line is a bit lower on Metcons, never owned them before, but I couldn't wear them to the gym with what I was getting. The hyperlift insert made it slightly worse.

They have good support, Zoom throughout, A nice higher type shoe, but I'm not sure. I know a lot about shoes but not about shoes for each position.

I'll give more info. I'm not a shifty, fancy, cross you up kind of point guard, I'm a simple set people up, drive to the basket and lay it in kind of guy. I often relate myself the most to Marcus Smart. Meaning I also play really good clamp and sticky defense, so I need shoes that flow with me and help me stick with people. 

I've previously played in Lebron 15's and Kyrie 5's. The 15's in my opinion were some of the best shoes I've ever played in. They could be a bit heavy sometimes, but they felt great on my feet and helped maximize my play. Kyrie 5's on the other hand, a bit disappointed with. I found myself not playing as good of defense in them, and I often felt like I was slipping on ice when driving a lane.

But I've seen a few sites I've never heard of selling the same shoes for 80-90, depending on the site. Do you guys have any sites you'd be willing to direct me to that you know is trustworthy?

182,Nike we got a problem here,"This is a problem with Nike’s uniforms in college and professional sports. Now before you start mentioning anything, no this is not going to be a political post. And I’m not trying to troll, I’m trying to provide suggestions for anyone who might know Nike dealers or anyone who makes uniforms with Nike.

But Nike, what is your deal with screwing up uniforms in both college and professional sports?

There are very few circumstances that a new designed Nike uniform in sports looks good. Take Clemson’s retro football uniform as one of the few examples.

What’s the exact problem with Nike? Let’s start out with

1. Coloring
Nike you have a problem with dark colors. What’s wrong with royal blue man? How about orange, or maybe powder blue? Take Ole Miss’ college football uniforms (I’m not an ole miss fan), they’re fine but they’d look so much better if they weren’t navy blue. So many teams have navy blue, it’s the least original color there is. And take the Miami Dolphins jersey before the touchup. Why would you include like a dark blue lining there? What was the point? Why did you get rid of the orange? And with the lakers, why did you change the color to banana yellow? Do us a favor, and stick with the colors that are already provided. Don’t change them, don’t add anything new, stick with the old colors.

2. Trying to incorporate their own design
Look I get that you want to make teams unique, like Syracuse with gradients, or the seahawks with that weird helmet design, but what people prefer is simpler classic looking jerseys. How many people do you see complaining about the cowboys uniforms, the crimson tide, or the Celtics classic greens? Every year, the lowest ranked jerseys in college football, professional football, and professional basketball are the ones that have too much going on or trying to incorporate their own “new” look.

And probably the most important one
3. What’s your problem with block style numbers?

Seriously did a kid wearing a block style jersey bite your balls off as a kid? There’s nothing wrong with keeping the numbers in the standard football font. Every now and then a different font looks good on a particular jersey (IE Bears, Steelers maybe), but 99% of the fonts Nike creates to add flair look very shit.

I don’t want to rat on Syracuse again but their old uniforms in college football had the most disgusting number font. You’ve made LSU’s font look like it was put through a taffy puller. You make the Dolphins numbers look like a malnourished child. You made the seminoles numbers look like they could rip my finger off just touching a jersey. 

Block style numbers aren’t bad, simplicity and the classic “football” looking uniforms are what people prefer. Pitt’s and Syracuse’s new uniforms this season are a step in the right direction, and even the Detroit Lions look alright, but you fucked with the numbers again on all 3. Please stop with that shit. 

Nike, just keep the classic colors, don’t try to add some “unique” flair to a uniform that doesn’t need it, and stay away from any number font that’s not a form of block style

I have no idea what they were called and now that they are gone for a few months I only now appreciate just how frikkin much I loved them. HELP PLEASE! Give me a name of what these could be called. I found some shoes that have aspects similar, but I need this EXACT pair my size like I had it. I loved it. I would buy 5 pairs of it now for the next 10 years to wear. :( (Also take better care of them).

I added a really shitty paint compilation of my legs with those shoes on. I hope it helps. You are my only hope Sneaker Wan Kenobi. When I won't be this poor anymore, I will definitely reward the kind soul who knows the model of this shoe.

Could it be too weak and rip very easily? I don’t doubt Nike in their design but it honestly looks like it is going to rip if you pull it a bit harder when putting them on. Let alone run every day. 

I had the 2017 model for 2 years and they were very durable. It makes some sense that 5.0 should be even more durable.

Last week there was a 20% off all clearance items sale that I got a pair of Epic React's from. I thought it was a nice deal, right? Already marked down, and then 20% less!

But now I go back to the clearance page a day after the sale's over (I got my days wrong thinking there was a day left) and all the shoes I had been browsing during the sale week just has a permanent 20% price reduction across the board.

So there was never a 20% off sale, it was just pure marketing. Hell, factoring in when taxes are added it'd be *slightly* cheaper to buy the shoes now then it was last week.",Nike,1561599074,MyManD,1,1,True,2019-06-26

21,I'm having a really bad experience with Nike returns and am not sure if it's even going to be resolved,"I received a pair of Nike Komyuter SE shoes at the beginning of January and was truly hyped as they look perfect on the outside. Unfortunately, to me, the pair I have is defective as the lace mechanism literally unties itself as soon as make two steps. The size I ordered is identical to the size of my previous nikes, which are the most comfortable and fitting shoe I own. The older model has normal ties, which do not loosen in any way, and I simply love wearing them. Unfortunately, the Komyuters are the opposite and they feel like they will fall of my shoes after the very first steps I take with them, regardless of how tight I make them. The mechanism does not hold the laces at all and simply loosens as soon as you move your feet in the shoes. I contacted Nike about it and they said the shoe should be ordered 1 size below your normal size - something that is not indicated anywhere in the description. This is not really true, because at the same time I ordered 1 pair smaller Komyuters from a different shop, as this size was no longer available from Nike official. And what do you know, it fit kind of better, but the mechanism was the same crappy design that loosens itself as soon as you start walking. To me, the whole design of this model is defective as the little mechanism that holds the ties at the back of the shoe is incapable of holding them and lets go as soon as you move your feet. What's funny is that the smaller shop honored my return request, sent me a DHL pick up for free, and refunded me within a week. Something Nike is seemingly incapable of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I contacted Nike at the start of January and they sent me the first return label. I live in the Balkans, EU and since it was delivered by DHL, I presumed I need to personally go to a DHL office and let them scan the label and pick up the box as no further explanation was given except the label and a ""preferred pickup date"". That was the first waste of time I went through, as DHL explained this is not their label and there's nothing they can do (and their office is at the other end of the city...). I contacted Nike and they explained to me for the very first time that it's a pickup they do with a different delivery company, one which never arrived nor contacted me in any way to seek me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward through Janury and the beginning of February and 3 more return labels have been issued for me, of which NONE were picked up - no contact over the phone, no nothing. I waited at my office all day long without leaving the premises for 3 different days and felt like and idiot that was simply lied to. It seems they only issued return labels but never sent anyone to pick them up, which is ridiculous as I had only heard good things about their support.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, after they did not respond to my last request for an actual resolution to this issue in days, I wrote to them that I will be contacting my bank and card issuer to seek help from them in any way I can. I've honestly had enough. Thankfully, the shoes were purchased during a period where the return limit is increased to 60 days, but it seems Nike has no interest to resolve this given what has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if anyone has had such an experience but I honestly can't recommend this shoe, or the nike online shop to anyone after going through it. And I am not sure if a chargeback would be possible, but in my experience I paid a premium price for a defective pair of shoes that untie themselves instantly after you start walking.",Nike,1550557953,b_fnk,2,1,True,2019-02-19

# INSIDE THE VAULT

##### THE STORY OF SAFARI

For Tinker Hatfield, ideas are a culmination of all your experiences and interactions up until that point. Anything and everything is of inspiration. Take for example, the 1987 Nike Air Safari. At the time, Tinker knew what he wanted to do with the shoe that introduced Safari print to the world, but how it was going to be done was still up in the air.  


“I had this feeling that luxury, comfort and the idea of taking an athletic shoe and purposely making it non athletic was a good idea”, Hatfield shared as he reminisced on the Nike Air Safari. “So I drew this up and presented it but I didn’t even have any materials chosen. I jumped on a plane to New York City and was just roaming around. I remember I went into this furniture store, the kind that you have to get buzzed in.""

I walked through the basketball section of my local sports store and noticed how utterly ugly basketball shoes have gotten with no obvious tech upgrades. I’ve been out of school for 3 years now thus never having a need to go out and buy new cleats or shoes to replace my worn footwear. I remember the Hyperfuse material, Nike Flywire tech, Flyknit, the bags of air etc and how truly revolutionary all of it was.

I own 2 pairs of Nike hyper dunk 2012 (low and a high), and hyper dunks 14-15 high and 16 low (in my opinion the 2012 hyperdunk low is by far the greatest hyperdunk yet, nothing about it from traction, upper quality and stitching, weight, fit, or aesthetic etc is flawed). I own Jordans 28-30 all of which are absolutely fantastic shoes, and revolutionary in their own regards (maybe not the 30 but the 28 and 29 for sure). I own magistas, and mercurials top of the line for their respective year, I own multiple vapours for football and just recently replaced my old hockey skates with top of the line baur nexus 1n skates. 

I look at all of these footwear and I can’t help but feel like we’re peaking in terms of tech. Maybe not so much hockey skates, but the tech being used on football cleats, soccer cleats and basketball shoes are almost a decade old. Basketball shoes are hideous now a days with no new tech. Like in what way can you improve on the Jordan 29? That shoe was perfect! How could you possible beat a fully flyknit upper? The traction was absolutely ridiculous and the rigidity was perfect. I can’t help but feel Nike and other sports companies are trying desperately to save and spread out old tech because the sports wear industry has peaked tech wise.

NIKE IRIDECENSE VAPORMAX PLUS, literally cool as fuck with the colour fade looking like purple sometimes and grey sometimes depending on what angle and what light you look at them in and can be a very stylish shoe to wear especially where I'm from where I think roadman shoes look sick. But it has a very bulky silhouette compared to the Nike react which looks a lot smoother and will go with a lot more clothes.

NIKE REACT ELEMENT 55: not sure what colour way I want yet but the silhouette and the detail is just phenomenal and the shoes are so intresting to match with clothes. However the colourways for the 55s suuuuck and genuinely makes me contemplate how I'll even wear them with clothes because I feel like the colour ways just dont do enough to promote the little and beautiful details",Nike,1552930949,drnkthadrip69,2,2,True,2019-03-18

I am new to the whole sneaker hype and releases but i saw these Nike x Off White shoes and they're so cool! I know that they will drop on February the 7th on 10:00 here in europe but i don't know where to cop them.

I don't want to resell them  and i don't want to use a bot. I just want to buy them legit but i have no clue on which site they will release. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope somebody can help me.

203,Nike therma performance hoodie sizing advice,"I just ordered an NFL salute to service sideline therma performance pullover hoodie in size XL. I'm 5'-11"" 205 lbs and generally straddle L or XL shirt and sweater sizes. Although I've never tried one on, I know Nike traditionally runs small so I assumed XL was the way to go. Then of course after I ordered I read some reviews on Nike therma sweaters that said they run a bit big!? Only sweater I really have to compare is an MLB Majestic hoodie that fits me perfectly and its a L. Just a bit stressed cuz I'm ordering it from the US (I'm in Canada) and having to return it if it doesn't fit right will cost a bunch of money.

223,Recommendations for/anyone out there with cancer-related skin GvHD?,"My feet are super tore up from skin GvHD. Especially the skin on the anterior portion of the ankle joint. Just destroyed. The Dr. suggested it might be aggravated by mechanical destruction brought on by the tongue of my sneakers (it's a low tongue and lines up with the wounds). I'm wondering if someone has any suggestions for a sneaker model that won't eat into my feet.

I bought a pair of  SB Zoom Dunk High Elites in a 13 (a size that's never failed me before in a Nike) because they essentially didn't even have a tongue but I absolutely could not even fit my foot in (bought them on ebay, can I return them to Nike?)!

I thought the High Vandal Supremes might be good bcs they're a softer material but I'm very concerned about breath-ability. Also the price, what with being out of work.

I can't tell if high tops would be better because that portion of the foot is tied in tight or if it would be worse bcs of all the additional tongue contact. Ditto a big, plushy tongue.

tl;dr: My feet are rotting away at the ankles, please recommend a comfortable sneaker.",Nike,1548812580,mikejkelley,0,1,True,2019-01-29

I have had these shorts for well over 15 years (I remember wearing them before high school and I graduated in 2006); if I had a cloning machine with only three charges I would insert these shorts in there three times.  They are soft (because they are all cotton?), breathable but not too thin, flexible (the elastic waistband and drawstring means they are secure always) and the inner liner means I don't have to wear a pair of compression shorts underpants.  The pockets and coin pouch are just a plus: I wear these constantly, both working out and not working out.  Are these shorts made any more?

What are your thoughts on those two pair of shoes ?

Also, I'm trying to get into basket-ball a little bit (I play outside) and have seen an interesting offer in another shop for a pair of Jordan Relentless Nike or some Nike Air Versitile with some other shoes.

267,Honest opinion about nike support,"Hey i just want to share my experience with you, and ask for your help, read through this if you are a sneaker expert or have had any good/bad experiences with customer service,

So about an hour ago i contacted nike support with a complaint about a Nike Air Jordan 1 Mid, and how the retailer i bought it from didnt really care, it had warranty tho.

So i tried to tell them everything that was wrong with the shoe, like: (pictures will be below)

 **Jen**: Aside from this concern, will there be anything else?   
**Farkas**: you guys made that sneaker, and after 2 weeks, the glue of the artificial leather resolved, because of raindrops  
**Farkas**: the jordan 1 mid sneaker had bubbles on it only because rain  

Extra funny: even 2 of my friends told me that they had the exact same problem with exactly the same shoe

So the support lady just dodged all my bullets, and then shut the chat down.

1. It's not normal that a sneaker falls apart because some drops of rain.
2. I didn't ever have high hopes for these capitalist companies,

BUT 

when i had the same problem with LEGO:

I bought a minifigure pack,that had a broken piece in it, and i had a kind of similar chat with a lego assistant, they sent me a brand new packet right after. Not a replacement piece! A pack!

If you want i can show pictures about that too.

SO, that really grinds my gears, how they just tried to ignore my complaint. I know that it's a profit oriented company, but sometimes they should care about their customers because not everyone could afford another €170 shoe, especially here in hungary. (&lt;- worst country in eu xd), I will probably try to write to the consumer protection agency, but here its also pretty poor.

65,Cross Training Comparison (Nike Free x Metcon X vs Nike Zoom Train Command vs Nike Free TR V8),"[Album](https://imgur.com/a/FHEB94q)

For starters... I'm not sure if the Nike Free x Metcon X is equivalent to the [Nike Free x Metcon](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-gym-cross-training-shoe-VKoLdD/AH8141-003)  which is what I tried in store. They felt very comfortable in store but [these colorways](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-x-mens-training-shoe-bjgDCK) just felt different to me.  Not sure if there's any difference or anyone else has had experience.

Three shoes tested:  

* [Nike Free TR V8 ~  Men's Gym/HIIT/Cross Training Shoe ~ $70](https://www.nike.com/t/free-tr-v8-mens-gym-hiit-cross-training-shoe-GZeoXk/AH9395-003)   
*  [Nike Zoom Train Command ~ $110](https://www.nike.com/t/zoom-train-command-mens-gym-boxing-shoe-spqPwg)
* [Nike Free x Metcon X ~ $84
](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-x-mens-training-shoe-bjgDCK)

Style: I give preference to the Nike Free x Metcon.  

Comfort: Nike Free x Metcon --&gt; Nike Free TR V8 --&gt; Zoom Train Command.  The Zoom Train commands soles are just too flat (probably why it's a boxing shoe). It wouldn't be very comfortable running or jumping or walking long distances imo. It's a pretty close though between the Nike Free TR V8 / Metcons.   
I might just end up getting the Metcons / TR V8's. 

Although I'm not digging that limited edition colorway on the metcons in person so I'll probably return those.
