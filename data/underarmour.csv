For those that have the Phantom SEs, should I stick with the 10 (11"" according to UA's size chart) that I've been using with UA or go by their size chart and get a 9 - 9.5?

are the maymy apps better than other apps to track workouts, do you guys use it, or something else, i used to use the NRC app and liked it, but really trying to use this mvp feature thoroughly.

Let’s say I’m still a beginner to fitness, have been into fitness for 8 months now- 

I haven’t been able to train my lower body (legs) due to injury at work. It’s completely healed now, but I’ve come to the point that my upper body looks ‘larger’ than my lower body. 

I train every muscle group twice a week now, should I train my legs up to three/four times a week, or just twice a week-(With heavier weights) to increase the size/strength? Don’t want my legs to look skinnier than the rest of my body anymore.

What do I do?

Let’s say I’m still a beginner to fitness, have been into fitness for 8 months now- 

I haven’t been able to train my lower body (legs) due to injury at work. It’s completely healed now, but I’ve come to the point that my upper body looks ‘larger’ than my lower body. 

I train every muscle group twice a week now, should I train my legs up to three/four times a week, or just twice a week-(With heavier weights) to increase the size/strength? Don’t want my legs to look skinnier than the rest of my body anymore.

What do I do?

7,I'm at a loss and don't know where else to look.,"So I have been waiting on the release of the Magma Orange colourway of the Under Armour Hovr Havoc Low basketball shoe for months ever since I saw the first images of it. It's quite possibly the most obsessed I have been with a shoe ever and couldn't wait to get hold of a pair (or two). Being a big guy and playing at a high level the Hovr cushion seems to suit my needs perfectly and who doesn't love a perfect herringbone tread pattern.

Finally news surfaced that It was going to be released on the 31st of October as a Halloween colourway and I would at last be able to get my hands on them. So Halloween comes and I am checking the UA site throughout the day waiting for them to pop up but to no avail, even after seeing release reminders on other sites. 

Then I discover that they have only been released in the US so far. I live in the UK so obviously this poses a problem. I emailed customer services asking if they knew when or if the orange model would release in the UK/ Europe and they said they don't know when or if it will but I can use the borderfree ordering to order them from the US site.

There was hope. I pull up the US site and go to order, even with it looking like it was going to cost 50%+ more with the shipping and taxes and duties. And It's sold out of my size (UK12/ US13) which was the only size that was sold out at that point i think, just my luck!

So I'm lost, I don't know what to do and I might just be completely out of luck and never be able to get my hands on them. I'm not really sure what I'm posting for but just wanted to vent my frustration and disappointment somewhere and hope that maybe someone else might know where i can get hold of them or if there is any more information about further releases or anything of the sort. 

Anyway, thanks for reading!

7,New to UnderArmour... I really need advice on what shirt to buy,"I went from 305 lbs to 195 lbs and I have loose skin. I heard UnderArmour makes compression clothing that can conceal loose skin under clothing, and so it from flapping around. 

I guess I'm fortunate that I never got big ""moobs"", so I don't have a lot of loose chest skin (although my entire skin-suit seems to have sagged a little), but my abdomen/ lower-waist is a saggy mess of loose skin. I'd really like to find under shirts/under clothes that compress my loose skin so my body looks better in nice, properly fitting shirts, etc. As of now I'm still wearing clothes that are too big and loose, just like I did when i was 305 lbs. I finally tried on some nice, properly fitting clothes, and that's what I want to wear. 

I worked really hard to lose weight without any medical intervention. I thought doing it slowly (a pound a week for 2 years) would make my skin shrink with me, but it didn't work out that way. I think it did reduce the severity of my loose skin, but it's still bothersome. 

I currently tuck my stomach skin into my boxers, otherwise it would hang over my belt line. I also have loose skin on my inner thighs. My thigh skin isn't visible when I'm wearing pants, but it does bother me when I'm working out, so I would like to buy a product to control it if possible. My stomach skin also bothers me I'm while working out, it makes a ""slapping"" sound and is embarrassing. And the way my loose skin looks look bothers me while I'm wearing my workout gear, but most of all when I'm simply trying to wear presentable, nice clothing. 

Does UnderArmour make something that could help me with my specifically explained issues? If so, I'd really appreciate it if someone could tell me what items would help me. I looked online, but I don't understand the differences in products. I do want something that is breathable though and will help me stay cool.

I train every muscle group twice a week now, should I train my legs up to three/four times a week, or just twice a week-(With heavier weights) to increase the size/strength? Don’t want my legs to look skinnier than the rest of my body anymore.

I wear a size 33 in jeans, but in my experience underwear is always tighter of a fit than what jeans are. These in size L just feel a little tight. Has anyone experience this, and if so, did you try an XL? Did that help?

Also, I have felt these things riding up my leg a little. This could be due to the tightness?

7,I'm at a loss and don't know where else to look.,"So I have been waiting on the release of the Magma Orange colourway of the Under Armour Hovr Havoc Low basketball shoe for months ever since I saw the first images of it. It's quite possibly the most obsessed I have been with a shoe ever and couldn't wait to get hold of a pair (or two). Being a big guy and playing at a high level the Hovr cushion seems to suit my needs perfectly and who doesn't love a perfect herringbone tread pattern.

Finally news surfaced that It was going to be released on the 31st of October as a Halloween colourway and I would at last be able to get my hands on them. So Halloween comes and I am checking the UA site throughout the day waiting for them to pop up but to no avail, even after seeing release reminders on other sites. 

Then I discover that they have only been released in the US so far. I live in the UK so obviously this poses a problem. I emailed customer services asking if they knew when or if the orange model would release in the UK/ Europe and they said they don't know when or if it will but I can use the borderfree ordering to order them from the US site.

There was hope. I pull up the US site and go to order, even with it looking like it was going to cost 50%+ more with the shipping and taxes and duties. And It's sold out of my size (UK12/ US13) which was the only size that was sold out at that point i think, just my luck!

So I'm lost, I don't know what to do and I might just be completely out of luck and never be able to get my hands on them. I'm not really sure what I'm posting for but just wanted to vent my frustration and disappointment somewhere and hope that maybe someone else might know where i can get hold of them or if there is any more information about further releases or anything of the sort. 

Anyway, thanks for reading!
