For those that have the Phantom SEs, should I stick with the 10 (11"" according to UA's size chart) that I've been using with UA or go by their size chart and get a 9 - 9.5?

are the maymy apps better than other apps to track workouts, do you guys use it, or something else, i used to use the NRC app and liked it, but really trying to use this mvp feature thoroughly.

Let’s say I’m still a beginner to fitness, have been into fitness for 8 months now- 

I haven’t been able to train my lower body (legs) due to injury at work. It’s completely healed now, but I’ve come to the point that my upper body looks ‘larger’ than my lower body. 

I train every muscle group twice a week now, should I train my legs up to three/four times a week, or just twice a week-(With heavier weights) to increase the size/strength? Don’t want my legs to look skinnier than the rest of my body anymore.

What do I do?

Granted it works as far as a scale goes, but I purchased it to connect to the internet and sync with my phone apps. It worked about 3 months then the WiFi has fizzled. I didn't change anything regarding my home network, but the blue WiFi icon has switched to gray. UA Record says it's connected but my data never syncs. ""Unable to connect to internet"" the scale always reads. So I end up manually entering the data. Has anyone else experienced this issue?",UnderArmour,1550580851,wnylibrarian,3,2,True,2019-02-19

So the question is, should I go 1 full size down (8) or just half a size (8 1/2)? Thank you",UnderArmour,1550628921,larabia485,11,2,True,2019-02-19
3,The UA Micro G Pursuit SE running shoe,This is going to be a really odd question but does the shoe that I stated above do they have tie laces? The reason I'm asking this is that I have ordered a couple of shoes that looked like they had laces but they are actually just slip on. I just want to make sure before I order they have laces that I can tie. Thanks for the help. I know its an odd question,UnderArmour,1550695835,Metsfan402,0,1,True,2019-02-20
5,HOVR havoc issue,"Just got some HOVR havoc lows in my true size. Fit is perfect and the shoes are insanely comfortable. 
While playing for the first time in them today I could feel the external tpu heel counter(plastic thing that wraps around the heel) pressing against my ankle. Eventually it became very painful and it ended up cutting my skin at the bottom of the ankle. 

Anyone else experiencing this? The shoes are great other than that big issue. I might have to try to cut a chunk of it off as I don’t see the heel counter softening. ",UnderArmour,1551242762,ricebowl2006,0,2,True,2019-02-26
6,2019 Summer Internship,"Has anyone else heard back from Under Armour regarding the summer internship program. I completed the online HireVue interview back in January and have heard nothing. 

 I'm just concerned how this slow process will affect my competing deadlines for other internships.

Is it just The rock’s logo ? I’m interested in the actual headphones, if there are any differences. Other than the look and the case etc.

[Greetings. I bought a pair of shoes mentioned in the title and it's the first day I'm wearing them and they are already ruined on the front top part. I had a few marks from driving or exiting the car probably, I got a tissue, wet it and cleaned them and that's what was left after that....](https://i.redd.it/o8yskm88ie521.jpg)

Is there any way I can repair them? Shoe polish?

Are UA shoes that bad? I really like the SC lineup and was looking to buy some more from UA, but at this rate of failing I'll skip the brand entirely...

1,Heat Gear Change?,"A few years ago I bought a ton of Heat Gear shirts. Recently, I bought some at Dick’s Sporting Goods online. The new ones feel markedly different. Markedly cheaper, thinner, and just not as nice. 

Did the company change fabrics or methods? 

I am considering changing to Nike Dry Fit because of the change ",UnderArmour,1545446235,CaptainBrosevelt,1,1,True,2018-12-21
