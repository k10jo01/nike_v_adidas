2,Thinking about ordering some HOVR Phantom SEs,"I currently wear a size 10 in the HOVR Sonic 2. 

According to the UA size chart I would wear a size 9 - 9.5 (10 5/8"" - 10 3/4"") I measured my foot and it's close to 10 5/8""

For those that have the Phantom SEs, should I stick with the 10 (11"" according to UA's size chart) that I've been using with UA or go by their size chart and get a 9 - 9.5?

I would try it on,  but I don't have access to a store nearby to try them on. 

TIA.",UnderArmour,1569203727,Dretsel,11,2,True,2019-09-22

5,UnderArmour canceled my order a week later?,"Hi guys,

UA canceled my order a week and a half after having confirmed it. It was a Project Rock hat and it just got canceled out of the blue claiming lack of stock. How do you confirm an order without having the stock?

6,Project Rock - Just paying for the branding?,"I was in Dick's Sporting Goods yesterday and I came across this Project Rock Track Jacket (Link below) that I thought was great. It felt nice and I think it it would make a great fall jacket.

I like to look for deals so I didn't buy it from the store. The first place I started looking around was the UA website. I immediately stumble across the Sportstyle Pique Jacket (link below) which appears to be identical to the Project Rock jacket, just without the Project Rock branding.

8,Shirt suggestions?,"My favorite shirts of all time are Under Armour tech tees I bought in 2012-2013. Unfortunately Under Armour has changed the cut and fabric of their shirts for the worse. The new tech tee, even though it is considered loose fit, really isn't. The fabric also feels plastic-y, and they made the shirt so long you could almost wear it as a dress. I really wish they hadn't modified a shirt that was fantastic as is. 

Does anyone have suggestions for a replacement shirt that has a loose fit, doesn't feel like plastic, and isn't ridiculously long? I'm no longer brand loyal to Under Armour as they seem to be ruining everything that made them great, so I'm open to suggestions for shirts from other brands as well.

Is it me or the UI not really friendly, like i use the app on my apple watch to get the heart rate and all that other good info but when i look at the workouts on my phone to get in depth info its just seems like clutter to me. Even when i run and the info syncs it looks alot better than a regular workout. 

&amp;#x200B;

are the maymy apps better than other apps to track workouts, do you guys use it, or something else, i used to use the NRC app and liked it, but really trying to use this mvp feature thoroughly. Any apple watch users just use the regular workout apps to track, what do you like about the map my apps or others...i just want somethign consistant to track progress and keep my motivation up",UnderArmour,1563970952,obm912,0,2,True,2019-07-24

Let’s say I’m still a beginner to fitness, have been into fitness for 8 months now- 

I haven’t been able to train my lower body (legs) due to injury at work. It’s completely healed now, but I’ve come to the point that my upper body looks ‘larger’ than my lower body. 

I train every muscle group twice a week now, should I train my legs up to three/four times a week, or just twice a week-(With heavier weights) to increase the size/strength? Don’t want my legs to look skinnier than the rest of my body anymore.

What do I do?
